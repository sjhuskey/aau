<p>This project explores the origins and global diffusion of Decadent writing, a style closely associated with European high culture and often marked by elitism, reactionary politics, and Orientalist imagery, but which was nevertheless widely influential in colonial and so-called “developing” regions in the twentieth century. Looking at a wide range of works by canonical nineteenth-century European Decadents and by fin-de-siècle writers from the European periphery and British colonies who were among the first to adapt their work to new local contexts, I argue that Decadent writing provided powerful models for capturing the paradoxes of economic and political development.</p>",

<p>Combining methodologies from literary studies, phenomenology, and religious studies, this project uses close readings of <em>The Tale of Genji</em> to make an original contribution to the global history of the senses. The tale’s multilayered narrative combines rich sensorial descriptions of the external world, complex internal worlds of characters’ thoughts and desires, and the looming presence of the eternal world of Buddhist renunciation. We follow Genji’s circuitous path as he moves fitfully between the external, the internal, and the eternal, forever denied stasis. It is the specific tension between the allure of sensory experience and the Buddhist distrust of the senses, I propose, that animates the text’s proliferation of looping plots, displaced desire, and obsessive repetition. Sensory experience, then, emerges against the vanishing point of Buddhist disavowal and through the reflective power of the mind. <em>The Tale of Genji </em>activates sensation even as it attempts to overcome it.</p>",

<p>The human mind is built to stereotype. When navigating the world, we categorize individuals as instances of types.

Yet, if we hear someone say, “You’re stereotyping,” we recognize the claim as an accusation of wrongdoing. My book project examines these apparently conflicting thoughts. How, I ask, should we conceptualize stereotypes and stereotyping? What are the best ethical objections to stereotyping? Is stereotyping always wrong or is it only sometimes wrong? Exploring competing philosophical theories of wrongful stereotyping, I argue that stereotyping is a special form of discriminatory treatment and advance a pluralistic theory of when and why it is wrong.</p>",

<p>Racial Uncertainties complicates understandings of school desegregation and racial formation in post-civil rights America. In a school desegregation case that was built around a black-white color line, Mexican Americans presented a challenge. Were they white or nonwhite? This debate was pivotal to the transformation of racial knowledge in the 1970s. As the courts wrangled over this question, Denverites tried to maneuver around the desegregation plan by claiming alternative races or by highlighting the arbitrariness of race, the elimination of which would have made it nearly impossible to create racial balance. Mexican Americans were central to these processes. The existence of such racial uncertainty is one of the hallmarks of the operation of race in modern America. It served an important ideological and political purpose: in the post-civil rights era anti-integrationists utilized the indeterminacy of Mexican American racial identity to frame their opposition to school desegregation.</p>",

The essay on Perrault's 17th-century French context explores his stylistic affinities with other (women) writers in his intellectual circle. The essay on the 300-year reception history in Britain and North America which I will co-write shows how the Mother Goose tales have been used in the Anglophone world to carve out a normalizing role for fairy tales, the figure of Perrault, and women's place in narratives of heroism. Designed for university and high school classrooms, my new translation edition will be the first collection of Perrault's tales translated and annotated by a French fairy tale scholar and the first accompanied by a critical essay on the British/American reception and nationalist deployment of Mother Goose.</p>",

<p>Native Voices is a permanent exhibition slated to open in 2011 at the new Utah Museum of Natural History. Native Voices will focus on the history, geography, linguistics, and contemporary cultures of indigenous people of Utah whose traditional homelands and relations reach well beyond the state's boudaries. Here, traditions persist and culture endures for five distinctive but rarely represented native nations: Shoshone, Ute, Navajo, Paiute, and Goshute. The project will result in an exhibition of 3,300 square feet of indoor interpretive space and an outdoor amphitheater. More than 500 objects from UMNH ethnographic collections and multiple acquisitions of new works by contemporary indigenous artists will combine with audio narratives (in both English and native languages), historic and contemporary photographs, film components, and live programming to create an exchange of ideas and opportunities for broad cultural understanding for native and non-native visitors alike.</p>",

<p>In a remote corner of the Navajo reservation in Utah, an art form believed nearly extinct has re-emerged with an explosion of innovation and creativity. The renaissance of Navajo basketry over the last four decades gave rise to a new form of basket - the story basket - that visually depicts traditional Navajo stories and beliefs. The Utah Museum of Natural History is undertaking a project to explore continuities and changes in contemporary Navajo life through the renaissance in Navajo basketry. The Navajo Basket Renaissance will examine Utah's Navajo basket weavers as both important keepers of tradition and agents of change in Navajo culture. Through a temporary exhibit at the Utah Museum of Natural History, a traveling exhibit, extensive public programs, and a catalogue, the project will engage audiences with living artists in a dynamic movement in a vital culture and help counterbalance perceptions of American Indian cultures as static or less ""authentic"" than in the past.</p>",

<p>In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in bringing a new set of tools to bear on traditional philosophical concerns. ""Experimental philosophy"" explores philosophical judgments by conducting experiments on people's intuitions about philosophically important concepts. Research in experimental philosophy already spans a wide range of areas of philosophy, including ethics, semantics, metaphysics, the philosophy of language and of science, and this work has also attracted the attention of a much broader network of philosophers. We propose an NEH Summer Institute on the topic. Experimental philosophy has grown rapidly over the last several years, but evaluating, conducting, and teaching work in experimental philosophy requires skills that are not currently part of normal professional training for philosophers. The proposed Institute is designed to enable participants to engage experimental philosophy as teachers, practitioners, and critics.</p>",
