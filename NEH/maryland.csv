The First Freedom Riders argues that their campaign to stage a civil war in miniature was unprecedented, radical, and highly coordinated. To disrupt and destroy Jim Crow in Gotham City, black activists built a new organization, the Legal Rights Association, that pioneered the art and science of protesting in public and developed strategies of civil disobedience—public set-pieces, boycotts, petitions, defense funds, etc.—that have become the hallmarks of grassroots anti-racism protests ever since.</p>",

These two conflicts have bracketed a century of American women’s participation in war. World War I, which sparked seismic social changes still being felt today, marked the official entry of women into the U.S. Armed Forces. OIF and OEF have involved women warriors in ways that would have been unthinkable a century ago. The contexts and consequences of these two conflicts also bear striking similarities, including large numbers of casualties from small explosives, swings in public opinion about the proper role of the U.S. in the conflict, and ambiguous outcomes. Such similarities make World War I and OIF/OEF particularly suitable for comparative discussion.

Special attention is focused on the doctrine of precedent, according to which the decisions of earlier courts constrain the decisions of later courts, while still allowing these later courts a degree of freedom. It is often thought that the constraints of precedent are carried through rules. In recent work, however, I have developed a new model according to which precedential constraint is a matter of reasons, rather than rules. The development of the law is thus pictured, not as the elaboration of an increasingly complex system of rules, but as the gradual construction a priority ordering on reasons. Later courts are constrained to respect the priorities established by earlier courts, but can strengthen the ordering with new decisions of their own. I propose to expand this line of research, and to assemble the resulting material into a book. </p>",

Douglass wrote three very different versions of his life (1845; 1855; 1881, rev. 1892). In this respect, Douglass himself offers us a warrant for thinking about his various ""lives."" From beginning to end, the book will thus also pay close attention to Douglass's canny acts of self-representation, whether in autobiographies, lectures and essays, or photographs. Douglass was a contradictory, complex, and performative figure who ultimately baffles efforts to reduce his life to a single story.

While some black and Asian writers protested Chinese Exclusion as an outgrowth of slavery's racial proscriptions, pro-exclusion agitators defended it as an antislavery measure in a democratic country committed to freedom. This book illuminates how these contests over post-war citizenship and national belonging led to the ratification of America's first race-specific immigration law. It adds to the growing scholarship in comparative race studies and broadens our understanding of racial slavery as historical experience, idea, and metaphor in American literary and cultural studies.</p>",

What is the phenomenology of being unified, both with oneself and with others? Is unity identical to goodness? I argue that unity is a teleological notion: an entity is unified when each of its parts contribute to that entity's realizing its particular goal.

This will lay the foundation for future work to develop a tool for use in visualizing archival collections from institutions using EAD to encode their finding aids.

While gender constraints deterimine that women through most of this period take conversation rather than oratory as a model for all discourse, at the end of this period, women's interest in exercises for students depends on the moment when they entered the market, rather than on gender roles. Women's theories anticipate current interest in the collaborative nature of composition.</p>",

The importance of the study for the humanities lies not only in its demonstration that Enlightenment, Romantic and Modernist assumptions about artistic ""freedom"" still obscure this aspect of Early Modern artistic culture, but also in its inquiry into the advisors' participation in larger technologies of political and cultural control--a topic closely akin to current issues in European History, Musicology, literary studies and other humanities disciplines. At Villa I Tatti this year (2002-2003), I am gathering primary and secondary sources, conducting archival and rare book research, and reading in the larger philosophical issues, but I require an additional year to complete a publishable text. The resulting study will document several hundred cases of ""advising"" (including several new examples), showing that artists of the period accepted such advice as a fact of their profession, normally functioning as collaborative co-interpreters rather than executants of the advisor's instructions. The study begins with an Introduction to the historiographical and methodological issues governing this topic. Part One is a study of the socio-cultural institutions structuring the advisors' interactions with artists, tracing the development of advising practices and identifying turning points (e.g., the Council of Trent) where new forms of advice or ""control"" arose. Part Two analyzes the advisors' written instructions as literary texts, and examines drawings and other evidence of the process by which these were transformed into visual images. The Conclusion explains how modern aesthetic theories and their socio-political preconditions have marginalized this culture of prudential control.</p>",

I explore how her art played a role in formulating black identity and in conceptualizing civic nationalism through visual means. My project resituates Fuller in the complicated historical past that she occupied, shaped by her identities as an African American, a woman, an artist, a wife and mother, a Victorian, and member of the elite W.E.B. Du Bois called the ""Talented Tenth."" My work embraces Fuller's biography but moves beyond it to incorporate Fuller's art as a way to access her complicated role as artist and citizen in the period from 1907 to 1921. My project addresses two important questions to Fuller's art: ""what do the sculptures reveal to us of the artist's convictions?"" and ""what do the sculptures tell us about the conflict between civic nationalism and the formulation of black identity in the early twentieth century?"" My study considers why Fuller's work was important during her day and why her art continues to resonate in the present. I offer a conceptual framework that allows Fuller to exist in her own right.</p>",

It is generally thought that the rules put forth in normative theories should conform to the standard logical treatment, according to which generalizations must be universally true. In recent years, however, a number of scholars have begun to study a new class of logics--known as ""nonmonotonic logics""--in which rules can represent generalizations subject to exceptions. My goal is to develop a treatment of normative rules using these new techniques, and then to explore the application of the resulting account to three topics in normative theory: moral conflicts, prima facie obligations, and the nature of case-based legal reasoning. The project should have an interdisciplinary appeal, attracting ethicists and legal theorists as well as philosophical logicians.</p>",

This book will highlight the important place of river boat workers, one of the largest non-agrarian working groups in late imperial China, in the social, economic and cultural life of Chinese local society prior to industrialization. By focusing specifically upon the river transport trade in Fujian province, I tell a story rarely told in studies of China's history before the twentieth century: how the activities and social organization of a group of non-elite workers changed over the long term. Key elements of the history of river workers that I analyze include the complex work regimes of boat operators, state policies towards the riverine community, crime and conflict on the rivers, and the efforts of old-style boat operators to defend their livelihood against competition from steam boats during the early twentieth century. With NEH Fellowship support, I will deepen my understanding of the Qing government's policies towards river transport management in the eighteenth century, map out the network of river god temples once located along Fujian's waterway system, and obtain materials on the political and economic history of Fujian during the early Republican Period to inform the concluding chapter of the book.</p>",

ABSTRACT: Study of opposition of students and the political right to the University of Paris in the decade before World War I, through a comparative biography of Emile Durkheim and Henri Bergson. Durkheim exerted an important influence as a Sorbonne professor while Bergson, in the College de France, offered intellectual support to those who rejected the world view of Durkheim and his colleagues. The New Sorbonne closely identified the value of scientific learning with those of the democratic state. In view of the 1968 student uprisings in Paris, it is paradoxical that many students then found the Sorbonne's progressive tendencies and its scientific treatment of all studies repugnant. </p>",
