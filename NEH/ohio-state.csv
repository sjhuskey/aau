<p>This book is the first cultural and material study of human-made and natural disasters in Late Antiquity (<em>ca</em> 250 – 700 CE). Focusing on the fourth to seventh centuries CE and on the tri-continental expanse of the late Roman Empire, it places disaster at the center of analysis, and investigates how late ancient Romans from across the socio-economic spectrum variously perceived and experienced disasters like warfare, climate change, earthquakes, and pandemics. Instead of approaching disaster as the primary variable driving a predetermined narrative of “decline and fall,” this study presents a multi-scalar, differential history of disaster, and shows how it led to a variety of outcomes that were directly related to social and political status, available economic resources, religious identity, gender, and geographic location.</p>",

I show how reflection on the nature of explanation and inference can be used to respond to these challenges. There is good reason to think that scientists now have an improved understanding of how models can explain and when they indicate the truth. This refined understanding shows how the technological and practical successes that science has offered are sufficient evidence for the truth of much of our scientific conception of the world.</p>",

Examining, on one hand, blindness in terms of language, and on the other, poetic language in terms of visual transformation, this project demonstrates the workings of blindness towards the creation of some of our most enduring poetry.

My project, New World Calculation: The Making of Numbers in Colonial America, investigates these questions in the context of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century colonialism. When enslaved, indigenous, and colonizing peoples interacted, they staged an encounter between groups who were each highly technically skilled mathematicians and held distinctive beliefs about what numbers are and what work they did in the world. At the same time, the tremendous accounting work required to support the economies of Atlantic slavery and settler colonialism, cultivated new forms of bookkeeping and ideas about the reliability of numerical facts. All of these developments led to shifting relationships to numbers and turned colonial spaces into testing grounds for forging novel forms of numerical thinking.</p>",

In turn, I show that the Russian modernist theater directly influenced the development of both philosophy and psychology in the early-Soviet period. Through close study of theoretical writings on the actor, rehearsal notes, plays, and performances from the early-twentieth-century Russian theater, the book demonstrates that Russian modernism treated the theatrical experience as one that is sensory and lived by both actor and spectator, therein anticipating American and European interest in the phenomenology of theater by several decades.</p>",

This political failure contributed to the end of the Roman Renaissance, replacing its values of civic humanism, classicism, and secularism with resurgent clan connections bolstered by intense religiosity.

These effects ranged from the expanding waistlines of British consumers and the radically homogenized gene pools of wheat and cattle to transformed agrarian ecologies in Argentina, North America and Australasia and geopolitical and military strategy during the First and Second World Wars. The transformed British diet was thus causally connected to the emergence of world markets, industrialization and environmental transformation.

But we still have no account that puts the early world of print in its fifteenth-century context. In “Origins of Print,” I argue that the technology of print represents not only a cause for future change but a consequence of changing attitudes to writing that stretch back centuries before Gutenberg. I trace the roots of print in the technologies and institutions of the late middle ages, and then describe the transition to print as it occurred. The story that emerges is no less refreshing than surprising: the cultural and intellectual transformation of late medieval Europe as a necessary prerequisite for the birth of the modern world.</p>",

My hypothesis is that London consciously cultivated a well-regulated judicial system, but that the court system would not have worked had the authorities failed to establish respect for their office and define boundaries of correct behavior. The dignity of city officials was established through ceremonies surrounding their election and installation, progresses through the city, oaths required of new citizens, public reading of city laws,and punishments for those who infringed on officials' power.

Religion was a huge component of late-medieval and early-modern culture, and lives of the saints were one of the most popular literary forms. Moreover, religious literature commented on all sorts of secular issues, from how to raise a child to how to rule a kingdom. The vital and dynamic genre of the saint's life thus can tell us much about both ""popular"" and ""high"" culture during the turbulent fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. My book focuses on a selection of major themes that recur in saints' lives of the period, including family life, orthodoxy, women's religious experience, and intellectualism. It considers the roles of authors, compilers, and readers in determining the use and meaning of saints' lives, and it examines the debt that post-Reformation piety owes to late-medieval antecedents.</p>",

More than anyone else, Edwardes contributed to major transformation of London commercial theatre in the late Victorian and Edwardian eras. My aim is to take the measure of his multifaceted career, and in the process to provide a microhistory of the artistic, economic, social, and political aspects of London theatre and its audiences in the decades before World War I.</p>",

French, German, and British scholars active between 1800 and 1860 were responsible for carrying forward the legacy of the early Jesuit construction of China (1580-1800), while also laying the groundwork for modern sinological inquiry in China and the West (1900-present). Due to China’s status as a literate and rational culture in eighteenth and early nineteenth-century Western thinking, the academic study of China during this period also played a formative role in the emergence of other disciplines such as philology, comparative literature, and comparative linguistics.</p>",

<p>We seek support for a collaborative book project, Rational Sentimentalism, currently under contract with Oxford University Press. The book will articulate and defend an original philosophical theory of the relationship between emotions and value. This sentimentalist ethical theory relies upon a novel account of emotion which utilizes both the findings of emotion science and the insights of humanistic scholars and writers about the lived character of human emotional life. We will then defend some surprising and controversial evaluative claims arising from this approach to ethical theory. Among these is our suggestion that although various emotions (such as envy, jealousy, and contempt) are widely regarded as hostile to morality, any adequate theory of value must acknowledge that all such emotions are sometimes accurate responses to value. With Rational Sentimentalism we aspire to make an important contribution both to ethical theory and the philosophy of emotion.</p>",

This seminar will explore narrative's power through an investigaton of some central issues in contemporary narrative theory: narrative progression, narrative ethics, and unreliable narration. Narratives to be considered include Jane Austen's Persuasion, Kazuo Ishiguro's The Remains of the Day, and Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes. Theorists considered include H. Porter Abbott, Wayne C.

ABSTRACT: Five teacher and graduate students have joined together as The Collection to bring live theatre and discussion about it to the theatrically unititiated, as well as those familiar with the theatre. Have developed ""Shakespeare's Mirror,"" series of writings from his plays, connected with narrative and song; idea of drama as mirror of life (comic, tragic, romantic moments). Not ""message play"" in sense of gearing to poverty-stricken, black or white audiences; instead, selection chosen for appeal to audiences as human beings. Live theatre shows how drama creates scenery with words; uses history to reflect past and present truths; gives insight to human emotion and speculates on nature of human existence. Focus on active participation of audience in theatrical experience, heightened by post-performance question-answer periods between audience and performers, who are also teachers. Especially suitable for high school audiences, where individual work with high school teachers on how to carry experience of theatre into classroom will be done; performances also suitable for college students and adults. Twenty performances during one year period to reach 6000-8000 people. Funds for live performances. </p>",
