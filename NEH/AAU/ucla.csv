Increased emergence of American Indian museums and cultural centers speaks to the importance of humanities collections in the preservation and even revitalization of cultural practices, and to the sovereignty behind self-representation. Humanities tribal collections serve to educate tribal youth, provide heritage in support of language learning, and instill pride in intergenerational heritage accomplishments of a community. Tribal museums reach non-tribal visitors and scholars as well, offering a crucial humanities perspective.</p>",

Over the past fifty years, Smith has developed an original compositional language he calls Ankhrasmation, which may be described as consisting of multidimensional visual symbols and considered works of art. His compositional language represents an original synthesis of graphic notation-based composition and ritual music in several traditions, European and American art music, and blues, and may usefully be discussed within these contexts—as opposed to a focus on the context of jazz or improvisation to which, as George Lewis has pointed out, the consideration of African American composers is often limited.

This project will develop and apply new computerised methods to translate and analyse the contents of some 67,000 highly standardised administrative documents from southern Mesopotamia from the 21st century BC.  By automating these basic but labor-intensive processes, we will free up scholars’ time. The tools that we will develop, combining machine learning, statistical and neural machine translation technologies, may then be applied to other ancient languages.

<p>Excavations at ancient Methone by the Greek Ministry of Culture in collaboration with UCLA have uncovered one of the most significant harbor sites of the north Aegean, occupied from the Final Neolithic era (ca. 4000 BCE) to the destruction of the site by Philip II, the father of Alexander the Great, in 354 BCE. Perched between the Aegean, inland Macedonia, and the Balkans, Methone served as a conduit for the movement of commodities, peoples, and ideas across a relatively large area of the Greek world, involving Mycenaeans, Euboians, Athenians, eastern and northern Greeks and indigenous tribes, as well as Phoenicians, in both prehistory and history. Significant remains include an early agora (marketplace) that lies above an Early Iron Age phase with an enormous deposit of artifacts, industrial debris, and--most importantly--the largest corpus of early Greek inscriptions on clay known from the Aegean, dating between ca. 750 and 650 BCE. Methone thus offers a unique opportunity to explore not only a large ancient harbor and industrial center, but also Greek connections with indigenous populations and others attracted to this large site that formed a middle ground between different cultures. During the protohistoric period, Methone played a major role in the origin and development of the Greek alphabet, contributing especially to the issue of its transmission from the Phoenician alphabet, a process with major cultural ramifications. The proposed project promises to illuminate these processes of cultural contact, the rise of urbanism, and the spread of literacy in the ancient world.</p>",

But the eminent thinkers of the Western tradition have not always been so sanguine. Hobbes and Bergson did not think laughter was benign. For dissimilar reasons Locke and Bahktin disputed this. The EQ encapsulates topics that scientists now urgently study. The course will deepen students' understanding of human nature by applying humanist insights to a contemporary phenomenon. It makes manifest the importance of asking EQs. Students consume comedy, but are only dimly aware that their amusement has political effects--due to laughter's nature. Moreover, they may not realize that media conglomerates sell their laughter as a commodity. The humanist tradition equips them to better reflect on these weighty implications of laughter. And they'll learn that when scientists dismiss humanist considerations, their science suffers.</p>",

Suspended Worlds is an interdisciplinary project that analyzes figures—specifically, bubbles, floating islands, flying carpets, and castles in the air—that embody imaginative speculation in aesthetic, philosophical, scientific, and economic contexts in the long eighteenth century. Suspended Worlds’ working thesis is that eighteenth-century writers invoke floating figures to imitate the very suspension of disbelief that fictional speculations ask the reader to engage.

In their capacity as merchants and traders, Jews served as intermediaries between Africans and Europeans in southern and central Africa and facilitated the flow of capital across these regions and the Atlantic. By reconstructing European Jews' participation in four commercial networks rooted in sub Saharan Africa (the trade of ostrich feathers, the trade of cattle, the mining and sale of diamonds, and the establishment of a web of itinerant peddlers and smous shops [general stores]), this book project will explore questions crucial to the fields of modern Jewish history, European history, colonial/postcolonial studies, and African studies. To what extent did Jewish trans-national commercial practices facilitate European colonialism in sub Saharan Africa? How did Jews fit into the racial map of colonial Africa: did the presence of Jewish traders complicate the meaning of ""Europeanness"" or ""whiteness"" in the colonial setting? And finally, how does the story of European Jews in Africa disaggregate the history of white colonizers?</p>",

Neither brother nor stranger, the neighbor is that particular other who marks the ambiguous realm between family and polis, hence serves as a touchstone for an ethics not fully determined by the obligations of kinship or state. The neighbor is both too close to be entirely reified or abstracted and too distant to count among the subject's group of intimates. The concept of the neighbor that arises from the biblical injunction to ""love thy neighbor as thyself"" (Lev. 19:18) has generated a vast history of commentary in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Yet if an ethics of the neighbor takes on its urgency originally in religious discourses, it does not remain exclusive to those discourses for long, and soon passes into secular traditions of social thought and practice. Hence after examining the primary texts and commentaries on the neighbor in the three major monotheisms, the project turns to a series of modern thinkers and situations where the ethics of the neighbor is first secularized (Kant, Hegel), and then returns in transformed post-secular forms (e.g., Kierkegaard, Freud, Rosenzweig, Adorno, Lacan, and Levinas). Increasingly, we live in a world where everyone truly is the neighbor of everyone else, a world in which globalization brings with it not only civilization but also its ""discontents."" This project investigates the history of the figure of the neighbor and its implications for the world we see unfolding around us today.</p>",
