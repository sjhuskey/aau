<p>""Free Land"" was a rallying cry of the 19th century. Land distribution is often understood as the culmination of the ""more perfect union"": a crucial place for locating the democratic ideals embodied in the United States. But the land was not free, and the nation-state's claims to western territories were contested by Indigenous peoples already living there. The 1862 Homestead Act and subsequent land laws supporting the development of the American West are disrupted by larger histories of Indigenous knowledges and land uses, processes of displacement and relocation, and battles against the challenging climate of the trans-Missouri West. This project reclaims stories that shaped the nation on its western fringes through a layered microhistorical approach that captures the textures and tensions associated with land transfers by centering on natural history, Indigenous land claims, the expansion of the nation-state, and homestead histories in four square-mile sections of the Great Plains.</p>",

<p>Japan is at the forefront of global population decline. I examine the implications of this unprecedented demographic transition in the context of the Japanese white-collar workplace. I show that firms are hiring and promoting more women and immigrants, but that gender remains a deeper fault line than ethnicity. This stands in contrast to Western nations, where native-born women are advantaged over immigrant men. I argue that because Japan restricts migration for the purposes of low-paid work, Japanese women remain the face of the low-status workforce, reinforcing views of women as less capable and deserving. In contrast, Asian immigrant men are able to disrupt historical prejudices. By demonstrating that the composition of low-level jobs is more important for boundary construction and inequality than that of upper-level jobs, this study overturns assumptions about how status beliefs form in the workplace, and advances understanding of how shrinking populations will reshape inequality.</p>",

<p>Richard Rufus introduced the teaching of Aristotle's <em>Metaphysics </em>and natural philosophy at Paris, the heart of the 13th-c. western intellectual world.

He thereby influenced the views of the great Scholastic philosophers who followed him, such as Roger Bacon's arguments for a beginning of the world, Albertus Magnus' discussion of universals, Aquinas' rejection of the ontological argument, and Duns Scotus' formal distinction and his theory of haecceity. After they were lost for 600 years, the British Academy (BA) began publishing our editions of Rufus' works, most recently his psychology lectures in 2018.

It contributes to humanistic study both by rewriting the history of the novel and by providing a history of eighteenth-century adolescence. By historicizing the conditions under which canonical eighteenth-century novels were written, published, and marketed, my work restores adolescence to its rightful place within the novel’s evolution, and demonstrates that many of the novel’s formal developments responded to cultural anxieties about adolescent readers. My last chapter will examine works by Sir Walter Scott and Maria Edgeworth to demonstrate the increased stratification of the novel market for adolescents in the early nineteenth century.</p>",

I have argued that Frege’s writings on language were meant as contributions to a different project: that of showing that the truths of arithmetic belong to logic. And, I have argued, it follows that his actual views about language are different from those typically attributed to him. But are these unfamiliar views of purely antiquarian interest? I think they are not.

A new Ottoman imperial identity was created, performed and propagated on these occasions. My book approaches the ceremonies as performances that created a space of negotiation between the authorities and the subjects. By forging a dynamic political and cultural link between the sultan and his subjects, ceremonies became integral components of Ottoman governance, and eventually helped establish a new Ottoman public space.

<p>Ivy Tech Community College (ITCC), in collaboration with Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), conducts an exploration of contemporary religious traditions in the greater Indianapolis area. Guided by religious studies scholars Edward Curtis and Arthur Farnley (both IUPUI), and humanities program chair John J. Cooney (ITCC), fifteen Ivy Tech faculty members, over the course of two years, study five world religious traditions that reflect the changing demographics and religious diversity of the city: Jews from the former Soviet Union, Russia, and Ukraine; Spanish-speaking Roman Catholic Christians from Latin America; Muslims from West Africa; Hindus from India; and Buddhists from Vietnam. Explorations of each world faith tradition follow a pattern of three sessions held over a period of three months. To begin, visiting scholars engage participating faculty in a seminar-style discussion of the history, sacred texts, and practices of the tradition in question. A second meeting the following month focuses on the same tradition in its American contexts. The third meeting then focuses on contemporary manifestations of the tradition in greater Indianapolis, with visits to a local religious institution to engage in dialogue with practicing members of that particular faith. Guest lecturers/discussants in religious studies include Jason Mokhtarian and Sarah Imhoff (both Indiana University, Bloomington) on Judaism; Peter Theusen and Arthur Farnsley (both IUPUI), and Arthur Canales (Marian University) on Christianity; Edward Curtis (IUPUI) and Waseema Ali (Muslim Alliance of Indiana) on Islam; Chad Bauman (Butler University) and Andrea Jain (IUPUI) on Hinduism; and Heather Blair (Indiana University, Bloomington) and Sister Ange (An Lac Vietnamese American Buddhist Association) on Buddhism. Primary readings include Mary Pat Fisher, Lived Religions; Hasia Diner, A New Promised Land: A History of Jews in America; David Wills, Christianity in the United States; Jane I. Smith, Islam in America; Sunil Bhatia, American Karma: Race, Culture, and Identity in the Indian Diaspora; and Richard Hughes Seager, Buddhism in America. The fifteen participants are expected to produce ten course modules each to incorporate into existing history, world civilizations, world literature, art and culture, and anthropology courses at the college. In a final public meeting (March 2017) at IUPUI, each of the participants gives an account of his or her experience offering one of the new modules.</p>",

<p>We will develop and implement a multi-scale workbench, called ""InterDebates"", with the goal of digging into data provided by hundreds of thousands, eventually millions, of digitized books, bibliographic databases of journal articles, and comprehensive reference works written by experts. Our hypotheses are: that detailed and identifiable arguments drive many aspects of research in the sciences and the humanities; that argumentative structures can be extracted from large datasets using a mixture of automated and social computing techniques; and, that the availability of such analyses will enable innovative interdisciplinary research, and may also play a role in supporting better-informed critical debates among students and the general public. A key challenge tackled by this project is thus to uncover and represent the argumentative structure of digitized documents, allowing users to find and interpret detailed arguments in the broad semantic landscape of books and articles.</p>",

<p>For decades scholars in computational musicology, music informatics, and other related disciplines have bemoaned the lack of symbolically-represented music. Such representations allow music to be searched, compared, transformed, and analyzed in myriad ways. Over the last several years the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP), an open library of primarily scanned public domain classical music scores, has achieved ""viral,'' status, now well-known in musical circles worldwide. This library allows easy and universal access to a wide and rapidly deepening collection of scanned musical scores. Optical music recognition (OMR), analogous to optical character recognition (OCR), converts music score images into symbolic form. We see in the IMSLP a potential gold mine of symbolic music data and propose, in conjunction with Indiana University's music library, to begin a long-term project toward developing the open source software needed to accomplish this goal.</p>",

My book focuses on self-defense, defending an objective standard for the 'reasonable belief' requirement for the defense, but comments at the same time on the standard of the reasonable person in other areas of criminal law and on the underlying issue of how to understand objectivity in a way that allows us at the same time to do justice to the particulars of a case.

<p>Where does order come from? How are seemingly random moments of disorder accounted for? This project maps an 18th-century watershed in Western responses to these questions. It shows a repeated pattern in domains as far apart as religion and philosophy, science and economy, law and politics: a family of new ideas about the origins of order, about causality and chance. The fundamental new insight was that even if God was no longer the active guarantor of order, complex systems generated order immanently through self-organization. Adam Smith’s ‘invisible hand’ was but one of many formulations of this new insight: it was a wide conceptual revolution that provides a new way of synthesizing many seemingly disparate themes in the 18th century.</p>",

During the Middle Ages churches had become the primary focal points of civic identity. By the mid sixteenth century church reform began to question this tradition, with the goal of cleansing churches of the secular. I examine how churches responded to this challenge, forever changing the relationship between the civic and the sacred.

Lerna and Kolonna, Greece.</p>
<p>The thrust of the proposed research is to test our conclusions for emergent complexity at Lerna with a comparable Greek Early Bronze Age site. Kolonna, on the island of Aegina, has been suggested as the first ""state"" in the Aegean complex (Rutter, 2001; Niemeier, 1995). At Kolonna we have not only the opportunity to examine once again this pivotal 150 years of rapid ceramic technological development (Walter and Felten, 1981), but also the archaeologically recognized distribution of the specialized products (Aeginetan Ware) from this technological phenomenon. Success in this project will not just add some crucial new facts to existing knowledge on the production, technology, and exchange of ""Aeginetan Ware"". If we see the same type of emergence at Kolonna that we did at Lerna, these conclusions will substantiate our new form of emergent complexity and a new method of explanation for such complexity in the archaeological record. In turn, these conclusions and method of explanation will increase our understanding of the elements that contribute to the formation of state society (and urbanization). This understanding is basic to the study of Mycenaean (Late Bronze Age) society, and through that to the subsequent development of classical Greece. This research project focuses on a specific region of the world and only the nature of cultural change in one artifactual assemblage (ceramics). However, this method of explanation has broader applicability. The approach offered in this research project is useful in any setting and would address questions concerning social complexity that transcend the details of a specific regional cultural history.</p>",
