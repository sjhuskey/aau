While Vietnam became a crude metaphor for military quagmire that observers readily applied to Soviet involvement in Afghanistan, my project pursues the far deeper cultural connections between the wars. Building on Michael Rothberg's concept of ""multidirectional memory,"" my book will explore the dynamic process by which the wars in Vietnam and Afghanistan, and by extension American and Soviet political identities, were continuously framed in relation to one another. The project's core hypothesis is that the Vietnam-Afghanistan analogy was central to how Americans and Soviet Russians negotiated both the meaning of these two conflicts and their countries’ place in the world. As I contend, these negotiations hastened the USSR’s collapse and fueled the revival of an American exceptionalism that outlived the Cold War itself.</p>",

<p>My book studies the politics of religious toleration in England and its emerging empire in the key period of the second half of the seventeenth century to explain how religious pluralism became so deeply rooted in colonial American society as to make a national religious establishment impossible by the American Revolution. Using a mix of local and official imperial records, its chapters examine the creation of new colonies (especially the middle colonies of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania), the laws regulating religion in them, the challenges to pluralism in both the new and existing colonies, and the contrast between theories developed at the imperial center and their implementation on the colonial periphery to demonstrate the ambivalent character of colonial pluralism. My ultimate argument is that America’s path to religious freedom was unsteady, depended heavily on anti-democratic English politics, and intersected with growing inequalities like slavery and dispossession.</p>",

Emphasizing the role of imperial politics in opening up new possibilities for toleration, the research also shows local efforts in America to restrict pluralism. In this crucial phase of the creation of American pluralism, religious toleration was far from universally accepted. It was contested in some areas, very limited in others, existing in different ways from one colony to another.

<p>This project examines the relationship between law and American empire in the U.S. territory of Guam.

However, Guam provides an ideal lens for examining the nature of American power around the globe. Bridging legal history and American foreign relations, this project contends that law and legal justifications need to be considered alongside military and economic power as crucial tools of U.S. imperialism. Beginning in 1898, when Guam became an American possession, and continuing through the span of the twentieth century, the United States governed Guam as an exceptional legal space where the Constitution did not fully apply. This project reveals the practical impact of laws and judicial opinions on a colonized people, and sheds light on how law serves as an important facet of both governance and resistance in imperial spaces.</p>",

The manuscripts suggest that for the Middle Ages, Virgil’s poetry served as a sort of secular scripture that complemented the Bible, while early printed editions show that to Renaissance readers, Virgil offered moral wisdom and stylistic models. From the eighteenth century on, Virgil’s poetry moved gradually to the cultural margins, with the various editions serving as unread monuments or handbooks of increasingly specialized knowledge. The protean character of these texts is evident in the illustrated editions, in which the same text is reenvisioned within each successive culture.</p>",

I examine Putah Creek, a prominent agricultural community near Sacramento, from its origins in the Gold Rush, through the bonanza wheat era, and through the state's transition from wheat to fruit. This was a community of remarkable stability, despite being settled by displaced 49ers on a fraudulent Mexican land grant. I analyze farm people's experiences from their own perspectives, paying close attention to their ethnicity, class loyalties, gender identities, and family networks. While my focus is local, even personal, my narrative also pays close attention to regional, national, and international forces.</p>",

I address why and how this investment in cultural life took place, as well as the consequences for audiences, governing elites, and actors. The successful expansion of theater outside of Paris, I argue, involved a transition from a culture of patronage to a modern commercial culture.</p>",

This project will build upon my doctoral dissertation, which investigated an early, important commission. A fundamental source for this study is Borromeo's correspondence, most of which is held in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Milan. This past summer, I researched all of the letters that Borromeo wrote during an early, formative period in his life (1559 - 1565). The proposed project is to read all of the letters that others wrote TO Borromeo during that same period.</p>",
