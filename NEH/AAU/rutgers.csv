<p>A Country of Their Own explores the place and promise of Latin America in the political imagination of African Americans during the antebellum era. As slavery and anti-Black politics of the antebellum United States were increasingly consolidated, by the 1820s the newly independent republics of Latin America adopted abolitionist policies while officially eliminating racial caste systems. Utilizing an array of sources including newspapers, travelogues, and government correspondence among other records across several countries, my project recasts Latin American and African American History by charting African American perspectives on Latin America in addition to the antebellum migration of fugitive and free African Americans to the region in search of racial and social freedom. A Country of Our Own will be the first book to weave together a hemispheric exploration of antebellum African American and Latin American histories through the lens of emigration histories and political visioning.</p>",

My cultural history of postcolonial children elucidates how these family disputes replicated geopolitical conflicts on a smaller scale.

Freighted with conflicting political and cultural meanings, the fate of binational children came to represent the future of citizenship, secularism and fanaticism, national development and international cooperation, feminism and human rights.

Lewis was central to America’s fight for racial justice since 1960, when he and fellow Nashville students applied Gandhian ideas to integrate Jim Crow lunch counters. A founder and chair of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Lewis led major campaigns from the Freedom Rides to the March on Washington to the Selma voting rights march. Ousted as SNCC chairman in 1966, Lewis entered politics, joining Robert Kennedy’s 1968 presidential bid, registering Blacks to vote in the 1970s, and in 1986 winning a seat in Congress, where he rose to be a deputy to the Speaker. Legislatively, he helped extend the Voting Rights Act, established a Black history museum in Washington, and served as “the conscience of Congress.” Lewis’s life story thus shows how the energies of the 1960s civil rights movement, in his person, carried on the drive for racial equality in the following decades.</p>",

The second is a history of imagined “Chinese” opera, of yellowface works that employ the “Chinese opera trope.” The third is a history of contemporary operas created by Chinese Americans and performed by major opera houses. Although these recent contemporary operas are significantly different from those that are part of the two earlier histories, they cannot escape being perceived through similar perspectives, as suggested by the receptions of these recent contemporary operas.

<p>The “Arch Street Project” is a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional effort centered around the disturbance of the First Baptist Church of Philadelphia’s cemetery, also known as LaGrange Place. The aim of the Arch Street Project is two-fold: 1) to maximize the research potential of this assemblage prior to its reinterment in 2023, and 2) to set a new collaborative model of bioanthropological research through full inclusivity, meaning all disciplines are welcome and able to contribute to and inform data gathering and interpretation. This proposal aims to produce a web-based, interactive archaeological site map depicting each individual burial and all its associated data. The map will allow users to filter and query data, view spatial distributions, and generate graphs and charts. Such a tool will greatly aid in the historical, archaeological, and bioanthropological interpretation of the cemetery and its integration into the larger historical narrative of early Philadelphia.</p>",

The outcome of the fellowship will be the first unabridged verse translation of Book Five of The Masnavi, the only previous attempt being a prose translation published in 1934.

What, exactly, makes a choice hard? This is a question that humanists--and in particular, philosophers--are best suited to answer.

Once we understand what makes a choice hard, we are in a position to think more clearly about what we should do in the face of them.

These volumes cover the pioneering era of the electrical industry founded on Edison's technical and business contributions and provide a detailed picture of the day-to-day struggles and innovations that delivered electric light and power into the world marketplace. During this period Edison also survives the crises of his first wife's death, remarries, returns to work on telecommunications technology, and opens his last and largest research and development laboratory.</p>",

These manuscripts reveal very different methods of research and argumentation from those usually suggested by the predominant models for understanding his political discourse: classical republicanism and biblical politics. The book studies these private documents, along with several of Milton's published political tracts written from 1640-1660, in order to understand innovations in seventeenth-century political discourse.</p>",

This approach contrasts with previous studies that have used interviews and questionnaires, conducted retrospectively and intended to produce quantifiable data. The analysis will show the dialectical process between experiences, information and self-understanding. Families are engaged in a process that is best understood, I believe, not in terms of the weighing of risks and benefits, but in the construction of identities that can survive what the body may not. I also will address the ethical question of what role ill children should play in decisions about their own medical treatment. Of late, this question has been approached in the medical ethics literature through the concept of assent. In short, the book will provide a rich and detailed description of the entire process of decision making. It will highlight social, cultural and moral factors that shape decision making. It also will contribute to current dialogues in childhood studies and biomedical ethics, and to the treatment of seriously ill children.</p>",

In the former sovereignty is a moral concept pertaining to the person who exercises sovereign authority; it defines sovereignty in terms of the responsibility of ensuring the common good as understood in Augustinian thought--the maintenance of a common order characterized by justice and thus by peace. In the latter sovereignty is a quality of the state; amoral in content, its central feature is to define sovereignty in terms of maintaining territorial integrity and state security against external threats. Recently the Westphalian conception has come under stress, being challenged by the idea that rulers who engage in gross human rights abuses against their people thereby lose their claim to the protections of sovereignty and may be deposed and/or brought to justice. These challenges are based on essentially moral claims recalling the earlier conception of sovereignty in terms of responsibilities. Yet so far the critique of the Westphalian idea has not formally engaged this moral idea of sovereignty or examined how a new theoretical understanding of sovereignty incorporating elements of the earlier conception might look. This project aims, first, to recover the older moral concept of sovereignty in religious and secular political thought from the medieval and early modern periods, and second, to bring it into critical dialogue with the Westphalian idea so as to suggest a revised understanding of sovereignty building on the strengths of both these historical concepts.</p>",

<p>This proposal seeks funding for an intellectual and cultural biography of John Rock (1890-1984), pioneering early clinical researcher in reproductive medicine and co-developer of the first oral contraceptive. Both of these developments have served to separate sexuality from reproduction, challenging deeply-held societal beliefs about the nature of family life, the relationship of sexuality to morality, and the basis for enforcing conventional gender roles. Rock's significance to the social and cultural as well as to the medical history of the 20th century makes it surprising that until now there has been no full-scale scholarly study if his life and work. Now, thanks to Rock's family, who have made materials available to me that until now have been inaccessible to scholars, that omission can be redressed. This biography places his work within 1) the intellectual context of the evolution of scientific medicine in the 20th century; and 2) the dramatic social and cultural changes in demography, family organization, and sexual behavior that undergirded the twentieth century quest for control of fertility.</p>",
