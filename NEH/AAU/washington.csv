<p>Savitribai Phule was born into an impoverished subaltern caste of Shudra (“low caste”) agricultural workers  in India in 1831 and she became one of the first Shudra women in India to receive an education. Along with her husband Jotirao Phule, Savitribai Phule opened schools for Dalit (“Untouchable”) and Muslim girls, and for children of all disadvantaged communities. This experience as an activist in education led her to write two books of political poetry in Marathi, each articulating her powerful vision for social justice and her fight against caste patriarchy. Her ideas about religion, caste, gender, and power made her one of the most important critical thinkers in Indian history. However, Savitribai Phule is hardly known outside of India and there is no English monograph devoted to her critical thought.

<p>My project analyzes how different Mexican organizations and communities have sought to appropriate and control information since the 1970s. During these decades, violent conflicts and the rapid development of communications raised pressing questions about the role that information should play in society: In whose hands was information safe? What did it mean to democratize information and whom did it benefit? Different groups—from Indigenous video-makers to blogging drug-traffickers—sought answers to these questions. Though their motivations were distinct, they shared a common goal of controlling and producing, or achieving sovereignty over, the information relevant to their communities and organizations. Combining ethnographic and historical methodologies, my project reveals how information struggles shaped the political subjectivities and imaginaries of ordinary Mexicans.</p>",

<p>India’s Mona Lisa, the model for the 18th-century portrayals of the Hindu goddess Radha in the Rajasthani kingdom of Kishangarh, was Bani-thani. A court performer, she became concubine of the crown-prince Savant Singh, who commissioned paintings that illustrated his own Hindi poetry and portrayed Radha after her features. Yet, Bani-thani too was an author in her own right. Her pen name, Rasik Bihari, or “Playful Connoisseur,” shows that she saw herself as more than object of the connoisseur’s gaze. This project recovers her voice by editing and translating her songs for the first time on the basis of newly discovered manuscripts. The book analyzes the songs in their performance context through the lens of the study of emotion. Their intertextuality with those by her lover shows the synergy of these early modern partner-authors.

<p>Since 2000, Peru has gone from being a war-torn country to being a premier culinary destination. Connecting chefs, state agencies, global capital, and Indigenous producers, the “gastronomic revolution” makes powerful claims: food unites Peruvians, dissolves racial antagonisms, and fuels development. This project critically explores these claims and tracks the emergence of gastro-politics, understood as a bio-political and aesthetic set of practices that reconfigure dominant racial and gendered orders. Although scholars have examined the cultural politics of post-war Peru, this project provides a unique view into how the interactions of race, species and gender shape the consequences of culinary nationalism. Placing ethnographic findings in conversation with readings of novels, production manuals, high-end menus, national-branding campaigns, and other visual texts, this work reveals how gastronomy connects to histories of violence, mestizaje and nation making.</p>",

<p>I hope to write, in the summer of 2016, the central chapters of a monograph on the morality of migration.

I want to demonstrate that justice has some role to play in how we understand migration—in particular, in the analysis of who ought to count as a refugee. Many more people, though, do not have a right in justice to move, nor a right to remain where they are if they have crossed borders without legal permission. My argument, however, is that we have good moral reasons to develop programs by which many of these people will be given the rights of citizenship. These moral reasons, though, have less to do with the rights of the migrant, and more to do with the creation of a domestic political society that demonstrates and practices the virtue of mercy.</p>",

<p>Why did the Russian tsar create a court theater in 1672? In order to answer this, we turn to sources that have rarely been used in the study of early Russian culture: newspapers and diplomatic reports. As our work shows, the origins of Russia’s theater are embedded in the communications revolution that took place throughout Europe in the 17th century. Our project makes important contributions not only to theatrical history, but also to broader historical issues. These include gender (the roles of the Russian royal women); the relationship between official diplomatic channels and the newspaper presses of the West; and communications and information exchange between Russian and Western diplomatic networks. Finally, in revealing the true origins of Russian theater in the 17th century, our work makes important contributions to the debates about “Westernization” in Russia, and the extent to which this pre-dates the well-known reforms of Peter the Great, beginning in the 18th century.</p>",

Beyond its postcolonial focus, the study has a further French Studies specificity: texts from the francophone postcolonies (sub-Saharan Africa, Maghreb, Caribbean, Vietnam) convey that water's use value and symbolic value are in great flux and that this instability is inextricable from past and present ties to France.</p>",

<p>The British Library/University of Washington Early Buddhist Manuscripts Project was constituted in 1996 in order to study, edit, and publish a unique collection of twenty-nine fragments of Buddhist manuscripts on birch bark scrolls, dating from the first century A.D. These manuscripts, written in the Gandhari language, are both the oldest extant Buddhist manuscripts and the oldest surviving manuscripts in any Indian language. They are destined to have a profound effect on the study of the history of Buddhism in India and the rest of Asia. Since the foundation of the project in 1996 a great deal of additional manuscript material of similar type and importance has come to light, and this material is also being studied by the project. To date, three volumes of studies have been published by the University of Washington Press, and several more are near completion or in progress. The current proposal seeks continued funding for the researchers engaged in studying and publishing this material.</p>",

In their capacity as merchants and traders, Jews served as intermediaries between Africans and Europeans in southern and central Africa and facilitated the flow of capital across these regions and the Atlantic. By reconstructing European Jews' participation in four commercial networks rooted in sub Saharan Africa (the trade of ostrich feathers, the trade of cattle, the mining and sale of diamonds, and the establishment of a web of itinerant peddlers and smous shops [general stores]), this book project will explore questions crucial to the fields of modern Jewish history, European history, colonial/postcolonial studies, and African studies. To what extent did Jewish trans-national commercial practices facilitate European colonialism in sub Saharan Africa? How did Jews fit into the racial map of colonial Africa: did the presence of Jewish traders complicate the meaning of ""Europeanness"" or ""whiteness"" in the colonial setting? And finally, how does the story of European Jews in Africa disaggregate the history of white colonizers?</p>",

It is organized around the battle of Adwa in March of 1896: a stunning victory for Ethiopian forces but a rout and a disaster for Italy. Adwa is deeply interesting in its own terms because Ethiopia is the only African country successfully to resist European colonization before 1914. However, it is Adwa's global context that makes the story compelling because Adwa--the story of Africans seeing to their own freedom--played out against a background of almost unrelenting European expansion into Africa and it resonated powerfully in post-Emancipation America where hierarchies of race and ethnicity were only beginning a process of challenge and renegotiation. The story of Adwa is visually rich and I see this project as an extension of my recent work on nationalism and visual culture into a transnational context, where the projection of nationalism was not only punctuated by violence but complicated by race. The overall objective is to tell the story of the battle of Adwa, through text and images, as the founding event in the history of modern Ethiopia, as a signal event in relations between Europe and Africa in the age of high empire, and as a touchstone in the global history of relations between peoples of European and African descent.</p>",

<p>This NEH grant will help build a Research Endowment for the Bill Holm Center for the Study of Northwest Coast Art at the Burke Museum. The mission of the Bill Holm Center is to 1) promote scholarly research on Northwest Coast Native art; 2) increase Native and public access to research resources; and 3) foster appreciation and understanding of Native art of the Pacific Northwest Coast. The Bill Holm Center will fund faculty research, graduate student research assistantships, visiting scholars and artists to do research on the collections and teach humanities courses, student internships, publications and exhibits. Inspired by the life's work of Bill Holm, Curator Emeritus of Northwest Coast Indian Art and Professor Emeritus of Art History, this center will be founded on the research and teaching principles that he established at the Burke Museum. Holm used Burke collections to do groundbreaking research analyzing stylistic characteristics of northern Northwest Coast art. This resulted in the pivotal book, Northwest Coast Indian Art: an Analysis of Form (1965). The indigenous arts of the Pacific Norhwest have been recognized by scholars as one of the world's most sophisticated and complex art traditions. Holm founded the discipline of Northwest Coast art history and provided a methodology for analyzing sytlistic differences and changes through time in tribal and individual artists' styles of art. Several of Holm's former students and colleagues continue to work collaboratively with the Burke Museum, and a new generation of scholars is carrying on this research. This intellectual foundation shows great promise for fostering future research that can reveal previously unrecognized artists' work and inspire ongoing Northwest Coast Native art traditions. We have raised over $353,000 in gifts and pledges, $287,010 of this given since Dec. 1st, 2002, and eligible for the NEH 1:4 match. The NEH grant will be vital in leveraging an additional $1,200,000 within five years.</p>",

ABSTRACT: Study relating popular thought in the pre-Civil War period (1830-1860) to the views of intellectuals in the same era. Fellow to use firsthand writings (diaries and letters) of commonplace people of the period to test two assumptions: 1) that an intellectual elite reflects and/or guides the thought of a society at large, and 2) that ideas ""trickle down"" in more or less diluted form from the intellectual formulators to the various levels of society intellectually beneath them. The period of 1830-1860 provides an interesting test of these assumptions since it was both an ""age of the common man,"" in the Jackson administration, and an age of intellectual awareness, fostering such movements as Romanticism and Transcendentalism. </p>",

Plan to conduct research, consult with social scientists working on the problem of violence at the Brandeis Lemberg Institute.
