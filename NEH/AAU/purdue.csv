Algorithms convert individual experience into data, the most valuable global commodity, and generate artificially narrow content to capture our attention. Through mass surveillance and information manipulation, algorithmic empires contribute to an erosion of trust in technology and a misinformed citizenry. The book makes sense of algorithmic empires by: 1. Tracing the logic of algorithmic empires for resource extraction and social control and its relationship to “surveillance capitalism”; 2. Cataloguing Facebook scandals in privacy violations and microtargeting along with gaps in its global regulation; 3.

J. Greimas’s (1917-92) methods for studying language, culture, narrative, and visual images. It identifies three stages in the unfolding of his ideas and devotes special attention to the third, ""Paris semiotics."" The theories form integral components of linguistic and textual analysis taught and practiced throughout the Romance-language world. The study provides a window onto critical transformations in textual studies and indeed the human sciences over the last century. Greimas collaborated closely with some of the best-known intellectuals of his day, including Lévi-Strauss, Barthes, de Certeau, Ricoeur, and Eco. By attracting attention to this central but neglected figure, and by drawing comparisons with English-language research, the monograph revises our postwar history of ideas in France and reframes the relations between English- and Romance-language traditions.</p>",

It argues that oil-patch evangelicals have long considered petroleum their special providence, a divine gift to advance His Kingdom. Driven by sacred notions of production and dominion, they have found an ally in the oil business, which has grafted these ideals onto an ideology of wildcat capitalism. This marriage has had profound impact. While money accrued through oil has helped evangelical clerics build imposing ministries, evangelical businessmen have used their religious commitments to advance oil's interests at home and abroad. This relationship has produced as much angst as hope for evangelicals, yet the trade-off has always been understood as the price of one's chose-ness in a fallen world. Whether praying in their pews for oil's bounty or for deliverance from its excesses, evangelicals have viewed their place in this sector as special and created a powerful subculture that at once honors God and black gold.</p>",

I plan to expand the database beyond three-volume novels to include all Victorian novels, beginning with two- and four-volume novels. However, the database is more than an enumerative bibliography: it enables larger statistical analyses, such as annual rates of production, the sociology of authorship, and the rates of serialization. Answers to these and other questions of book production broaden the context for the understanding of individual authors and texts and their relationship to the larger cultural sphere.</p>",

Briefly put, the value of mathematics for scientific representation is epistemic. That is, by appealing to mathematical concepts and theorems, scientists are able to formulate theories that can be highly confirmed by the available evidence. Without mathematics, scientific theories would still be possible, but they would be less well confirmed. I reach these conclusions through a careful consideration of the different ways in which mathematics can be useful in science and by reviewing the main alternative accounts of how mathematics is applied. After articulating my epistemic proposal, I test it using an extended case study from the history of meteorology. My project concludes by exploring the consequences of this view of applied mathematics for the metaphysics and epistemology of pure mathematics.</p>",

Arguing for the significance of transregionality and city-node centers as a major factor in the expansion of Sufism during this period, this book project will focus on the sacred city of Mecca and its heretofore underestimated role in the development of Sufi networks during what remains an under-researched period of its history.
