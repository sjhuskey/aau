Second, this is not a traditional anthropological ethnography, but one that integrates archival research with analysis of secondary newspaper and academic sources, and oral histories and interviews. Third, rather than a historical biography, it is more aptly described as an ethnography of the shifting terrain of the model minority discourse during the Cold War, focusing on a family that was at the center of the media attention, and exploring the continuing effects of this discourse as it circulated. I examine how it has been re-narrated to reflect current generations’ desired interpretations of their own history and future trajectory.</p>",

<p>The focus of this project for the Michigan State University Museum is the Doris Neilson doll collection consisting of 160 dolls, puppets, marionettes and doll-related items made by indigenous peoples from many cultures.This doll collection is incredibly comprehensive and presents dolls and puppets from many different cultures throughout the world. It is important to preserve this collection as it represents past and current entertainment traditions, and also documents traditional costumes from many cultures, especially as some of these customs and manners of dress are changing and becoming more homogenous over time. These collections are used for research, education, and exhibition projects. With the proposed Preservation Assistance Grant, the MSU Museum will purchase a museum-quality storage cabinet and archival material to house the Doris Neilson doll collection. The funds will also enable us to hire a student intern for six months to assist with the rehousing project.</p>",

The language belongs to the Southern Highlands Language group of Tanzania. The objectives of the project include (a) describing the linguistic features of the language and writing a descriptive grammar; (b) audio and video recording of cultural texts such as folktales, conversations, rituals, songs and language games; (c) compiling folktales and oral traditions for wider readership in the community; and (d) using data from Kikisi to explore the nature of words in language. The documentation and descriptive grammar will generate new data for issues studied by linguists of diverse theoretical persuasions. The study will also add invaluable data to the field of Bantu linguistics, where the genetic classification and sub-classification of languages in southern Tanzania remains unclear. The broader impacts of this study include a significant contribution to the Languages of Tanzania project to document all languages and produce a linguistic atlas. For the Kikisi people the documentation will constitute a rare opportunity to record and preserve the language. (Edited by staff)</p>",

The Forum sponsors lectures, conferences, publication, and teaching, as well as graduate, post-doctoral, and senior fellowships - all with any eye to bringing together the best representatives of the scientific and humanistic approaches to the study of human affairs.</p>",

In mid-18th century considerable number of composers in Northeast states represented first school of composers in this county whose work is indigenous. Billings (1746-1800) most admired and best know of these men, broke decisively with contemporary repertoire of sacred music imported from England. In keeping with aims of the young Republic, his psalm-tunes, and anthems and revolutionary songs had a simplicity and down-to-earth quality which made them the popular music of his time. With influx of European musicians in 1790s, Billings' music (and that of his American contemporaries) lost its appeal, was neglected during 19th century and rediscovered only in recent years. Work will contribute to re-evaluation of 18th century American music, illuminating a significant period of American civilization. Relates to Bicentennial. Funds for summer salary, copying supplies, travel to Library of Congress and various New England and New York depositiories of documents and manuscripts. </p>",

ABSTRACT: Project to complete research in England for a monograph on the joint pastoral censuring English liberal Catholicism (December, 1900). A crucial stage in the secularization of western thought occurred in the 19th century with the impact of ""scientific"" Biblical and historical criticsim; the idea of evolution, philosphical subjectiveism, challenged traditional Christian beliefs. Pastoral was was a response to radical liberal criticisms of the Church. Brought to an end publication of articles critical of the Church and cast a cloud over even the moderate liberals' attempts to reconcile Catholicism with contemporary culture. Seeds of current turmoil in religion is to be found in pre-World War I period; study of Catholic community in England at the beginning of the century provides an important contribution to understanding roots of the current theological perplexities. </p>",
