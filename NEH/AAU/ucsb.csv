<p>How do we understand conflicting claims to land and land’s relationship to colonialism? This is the question of Palestine. At its best, this question can offer new ways to think about land and history. Yet, histories and historiographies of Palestine remain limited to the territorial and conceptual borders of the nation-state. My book project, From Baltimore to Beirut: On the Question of Palestine, charts an escape from nationalist confines. The central figure of my narrative is a Palestinian man who was at once a colonial officer and a colonized subject, an enslaver and a refugee. I explore how his trajectory from nineteenth century mobility across Baltimore and Sudan to twentieth century immobility in Lebanon places the question of Palestine in a global history of race, capital, slavery, and dispossession.</p>",

Faces of Faith shows that trans people have re-envisioned established religious forms so as to be seen and heard within their chosen traditions. In the U.S., these forms include singing in Gospel choirs; cooking “church food”; quoting Bible verses and preaching; building altars for saints and the Virgin Mary; and paying homage to Afro-Diasporic gods and ancestors. <em>Faces of Faith</em> documents the reclamation of these religious forms through innovative “de-Othering” strategies. The first book to provide a richly textured analysis of Black and Latinx trans religious practitioners, <em>Faces of Faith</em> promises to be a pathbreaking contribution to religious studies, anthropology, and women’s and gender studies.</p>",

In the half century before World War I, over a million Muslims from Russia arrived as refugees in the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman government resettled them throughout the empire: from the Balkans in the west, through Anatolia, to Iraq and Transjordan in the east. This book project is a social history of migration that shows how Muslim refugees transformed the late Ottoman Empire and how the Ottomans constructed a massive infrastructure to manage refugee flows. Using documents in Ottoman Turkish, Arabic, and Russian, I argue that imperial support, in the form of financial aid and infrastructure, was critical for the economic success of refugee villages, which in turn proved fundamental to Ottoman political stability. By asserting the notion of an Ottoman refugee regime, the book marries Ottoman and Islamic history with global refugee and migration studies.</p>",

<p>Human Rights in the Arab World will produce empirical research and comparative analysis about human rights in the region as a whole, and thus will contribute to the production of humanistic knowledge about human rights practice and discourse in ways that also will enhance future research, rights advocacy, and public policy. Our research incorporates an historical comparative view, but is particularly attentive to the relationship between human rights activism and the revolutionary upheavals &ndash; and in some contexts counter-revolutionary repression&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;since 2011 (i.e., the so-called ""Arab Spring""). Our overarching goals are to probe the impact of struggles to promote and defend rights prior to and since these upheavals, to document and analyze the work of human rights organizations across the region, and to assess the degree to which human rights discourse informs public consciousness and political struggles for democratic change as well as accountability for gross violations.</p>",

My analysis hinges upon the mind’s capacity to represent the world. I will argue that Bayesian cognitive science assigns a central explanatory role to mental representation. Bayesian modeling reveals that core mental activities such as perception, action, and decision-making all crucially involve representational aspects of mentality. My analysis should advance our understanding of the mind by establishing that mental representation is an indispensable theoretical notion.

In the early modern world opposite Truths fought one another, and theologians were tasked with asserting their own Truth as absolutely certain. Probabilism was a novel and controversial kind of Catholic moral theology: it stressed the uncertainty and fallibility of all human religious and political norms, and it sought to find theological and epistemological venues for compromise. Examining how early modern probabilists grappled with their moral dilemmas allows us to see more clearly the roots and significance of our own quandaries and to put them in a wider and deeper perspective.</p>",

Uniquely, it allows users to add metadata on top of standard bibliographical data to facilitate a social-network-like sense of active relation to the objects of research. RoSE is in early prototype. We seek to improve several key areas so that we can make RoSE available as an ""open beta"" for humanities scholars and other digital humanities projects to explore.</p>",

Even as the Victorian economy divided the world into producing and consuming nations, it also created structures and ideologies that broke down those divisions and imagined much of the world as potential consumers. Though economic historians have long acknowledged the significance of non-western markets, recent scholarship has failed to consider how imperialism shaped the cultural, social and political history of global consumer cultures.

As in the Roman world, an artisan in China was defined as anyone or made or decorated things with their hands. In China, this label included painters, sculptors, founders, masons, woodcarvers, and many other occupations. Because artisans toiled with their hands, they were denigrated by Chinese intellectuals and men in power. Thus, few historical texts record their activities or describe their living and working conditions. In fact, no monograph in English has ever attempted to detail the social and economic circumstances of this group. I intend to use a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to reconstruct the lives and careers of men and women in this vital social group in Early China. I will utilize the scattered references to artisans in received texts, and bolster them with analyses of excavated workshop sites, pictorial depictions of artisans at work, recently excavated contemporary texts, and inscriptions carved on objects by the artisans themselves. I will break down this social history contextually, separately addressing ""Artisans in Society,"" ""Artisans in the Workshop,"" ""Artisans in the Marketplace,"" ""The Illustrative Artisan,"" and ""The Un-free Artisan.""

Paolo fuori le Mura in Rome between 1825 and 1930, and in particular on official representations of the project and their public reception at the Roman, Italian, and international levels. The rebuilding followed the destruction by fire of the original fifth-century basilica of S. Paolo in 1823, and developed into the longest-running, most important, and costliest work of Church-sponsored architecture in Rome during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The project was immediately loaded with a variety of different meanings by groups all along the political and religious spectrum; meanings that inevitably mutated constantly during a period that saw the revolutions of 1848-9, the unification of Italy, the end of the Pope's temporal rule, the tense period of the ""Roman questions,"" the crisis of the liberal state and the rise of Fascism, and the great Reconciliation of Church and State in the Lateran Pacts of 1929. By examining public discourse on the church as represented in newspaper articles, essays, polemics, memoirs, engraved prints, popular culture, official proclamations, speeches, and ceremonies, I aim to uncover how presentations of and commentaries on S. Paolo reflected this continually fluctuating political situation. In so doing, my project will make a contribution to our understanding of a central theme in modern Italian history, namely, the long battle to define the historical meaning of Rome and thus to control its contemporary significance. At the level of the humanities in general, the book will broaden our awareness of how historical imagery and memorial land- and cityscapes have been used to project messages of authority, and crucially, how those projected messages have been received, contested, or even misunderstood by the publics they target.</p>",

The drama of the ending of the war has been studied mainly from the perspective of U.S.-Japanese relations, with the central focus on the impact of the atomic bombs on Japan's decision to surrender. This project brings the Soviet factor to center stage. Reassessment of the Soviet factor is not possible without utilizing multi-national sources, which can be best collected and analyzed through international collaboration. This is the first collaborative project that brings together experts from these three nations to reexamine the ending of the Pacific war. By incorporating multi-national sources, we intend to prove that Soviet actions and policies played a crucial role in shaping the course of events leading to the end of the Pacific War.</p>",
