Scientists have measured the grave effects of this crisis for decades, but the interpretive approaches afforded by the humanities are crucial for appreciating human responses to a rapidly evolving scientific reality. The climate crisis demands that humanity reckon and wrestle with its relationship to the environment, and as global citizens become ever more aware of the urgency of the climate crisis, the need for rigorous reporting on multifaceted responses to environmental change has never been more crucial. Recognizing that these responses are influenced by a complex constellation of religious, political, and socioeconomic factors, our project will offer a ten-episode podcast season exploring the rich stories of how various groups and movements have interpreted and re-imagined human modes of interaction with the natural world.</p>",

Property ownership was central to Black visions of freedom following emancipation. But racist practices, invisible obstacles, and hidden traps made it difficult for them to hang on to their property. Of these, few were more powerful, or more quietly destructive, than the property tax. This project shows how discriminatory over-assessment of Black-owned property and manipulation of tax delinquency laws by local officials and private investors fueled Black land loss and shaped the landscape of racial inequality in 20th century America. It also shows how Blacks fought for fair and equitable tax laws and their rights as taxpayers and citizens.</p>",

Second, how was this process of commodification – with its related impetuses and impacts – related to the development of capitalism around the Mediterranean basin? I argue that prominent Beiruti families who formed joint-stock companies in the mid-nineteenth century relied on forms of sharecropping rooted in the Ottoman social formation as the most efficient techniques for local capital accumulation in the Levant. Only during the First World War did the firms’ land tenure arrangements in parts of Greater Syria and Palestine begin to take on a commodified form, making them acceptable to European buyers. Indeed, the crisis of World War I concretized processes that were already underway in the Levant from the mid-nineteenth century and transformed the shape of capitalism globally.</p>",

<p>The significance of the Washington Papers project rests initially on the profound importance of Washington's correspondence, the project's productivity record, nearness to completion, and important digital ventures (notably the Digital Edition and the Financial Papers project).  These efforts, along with active engagement with scholars, teachers, and the general public, keep the Washington Papers at the forefront of both documentary editing and the digital humanities. Washington's personal letters to and from family and friends reveal his dedication to public service, but they also expose a human figure, learning from mistakes in business, war, and politics to become his country's foremost leader.  These letters also document the actions and aspirations of enslaved people, free men and women, Native Americans, frontier inhabitants, farmers, scientists, and many others. The addition of the Washington Family Papers Series to the project only expands this context.</p>",

No political thinker has delved into the question of the “common good” more profoundly than Alexis de Tocqueville. For Tocqueville, the idea of the common good was the result of a society’s reflection upon itself, a reflection guided by the light of the Tocquevillean concept of “self-interest properly understood.” Tocqueville's insights penetrate to the heart of the “liberal democratic values” frequently invoked in contemporary political debate but less frequently examined.

We aim to make the Heptameron available to the general reader, the college classroom, and to researchers in a number of fields across the humanities and social sciences, from history and religious studies to gender studies and comparative literature.

<p>A cooperative agreement for a two-year faculty and curriculum development project on the religions and cultures of Asia, the Middle East, and Russia for thirty-six faculty and academic administrators from five Virginia community colleges. In partnership with Blue Ridge Community College, the University of Virginia's Asia Institute received support for a project to help community colleges incorporate new content on Asia, the Middle East, and Russia in their curricula. In the first year, participants recruited from Southwest Virginia Community College, Piedmont Virginia Community College, J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College, Blue Ridge Community College, and Virginia Western Community College focus on the ancient heritages of Japan, China, India, the Middle East, and Russia, with emphasis on literature, arts, and religion. In the second year, they study the modern societies that have developed in those regions through literature and film, with attention paid to their interactions with the West. A symposium each year introduces participants to the topics through common readings, discussion, and lectures from scholarly experts. In addition, participants choose a geographic or thematic area on which to focus, tailored to the specific needs of their institutions. Between symposia, participants work with each other and with the scholars using discussion forums, video conferencing, and site visits as they develop and implement new curricular materials. The Asia Institute draws on the expertise of project director Rachel Stauffer, as well as University of Virginia faculty members Daniel Ehnbohm, Paul Groner, Gustav Heldt, Haruko Yuda, Karen Lang, Robert Hueckstedt, Richard Cohen, Ahmad Obiedat, Edith Clowes, John Nemec, Michiko Wilson, Allison Alexey, Charles Laughlin, Mehr Farooqi, and Farzaneh Milani, Reginald Jackson (University of Chicago), and Matthew Marshall (Hollins University). Readings include such classic texts as The Dream of the Red Chamber, Doctor Zhivago, and The Tale of Genji, as well as secondary works by scholars including Jonathan Spence, Diana Eck, Leila Ahmed, and several of the presenting scholars. Participants also view and discuss several documentaries and feature films, including Mr. and Mrs. Iyer, Monsoon Wedding, Rashomon, Battleship Potemkin, and The Vanished Empire.</p>",

Although archives are doing their best to ensure that source communities can ultimately gain access to the language materials they produce, little is being done to facilitate their involvement in the ongoing curation of those materials. Enhancing and extending such involvement will significantly increase both the scholarly value of documented materials and its impact in source communities. Using the situations of rural Papua New Guinea and Cameroon as model cases, this project will bring together an international group of scholars, technical experts, and community members for a two day conference to intensively explore appropriate “bridging” technologies and make recommendations to help digital language archives overcome fundamental obstacles to maintaining direct, ongoing relationships with archive stakeholders who reside in less-networked communities.</p>",

<p>Leonardo da Vinci: Between Art and Science examines the relations between art and science in the Renaissance, when disciplinary boundaries were not as clearly distinct as they are today. Combining the history of art, science, literature, and technology, the proposed Institute for College and University Teachers focuses on the works of Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), the versatile, canonical artist of western art who moved with equal ease among artistic, literary, and scientific circles. The Institute focuses on Leonardo’s research to transfer observations from one system of representation (geometrical and scientific diagrams) to another (painting and drawing). Ultimately, by concentrating on how Leonardo saw the relations between art and science, the Institute elucidates the processes at the root of modern science: how to record, visualize, and abstract first-hand observations, and, even more importantly, how to translate these observations from one system of representation to another.</p>",

But critical scholarship depends on having access to these works - many of which are rare, out-of-print, and difficult to locate. Artists' Books Online is a networked digital resource designed to provide access to these books in virtual facsimile as page images accompanied by extensive metadata in a form that creates substantial commentary. The infrastructure of the ABsOnline prototype has been designed to aggregate materials that are geographically dispersed into a single ""collection"" of online objects. NEH funded activity would test a model of ""distributed content development"" for the repository. By working with a handful of selected collaborators, I will test the viability of building a community of contributors and scaling this prototype of collaborative, online scholarship.</p>",

Drawing on my past fieldwork on Arapesh, as well as on the fruits of collaborative work currently underway with support from a DEL-NEH institutional grant for the Arapesh Digital Language Archive, I will devote the fellowship year to writing the core chapters of an Arapesh reference grammar. Arapesh is of special significance to linguistic theory for its typologically unusual system of noun classification that elaborates phonological, as opposed to semantic, principles of morphological class assignment and syntactic agreement. Like other Arapesh varieties, the Cemaun dialect of Mountain Arapesh this project documents is seriously endangered; there are fewer than 100 speakers, none of whom are under 40 and none of whom are Arapesh monolingual. The grammar will be theoretically informed but ecumenical, comprehensively describing the Cemaun dialect while synthesizing the data on variation across the Arapesh family as a whole. It will be based on elicited linguistic data and more than 50 texts representing different genres of discourse, including conversation, that I audiorecorded, transcribed, and annotated in the field. Together with the Arapesh Digital Language Archive currently being constructed at the University of Virginia, the grammar will lay the foundation for pedagogical materials to be created later for use in Arapesh village schools.

This massive body of material, held in the Archivio Segreto Vaticano, has never before been explored systematically for this or any other purpose. The investigator will illuminate the operations of the patriarchal, ""positional,"" coercive family, which (contrary to the claims of Lawrence Stone and others) remained very much the norm at least until the end of the eighteenth century.

The goal of this fellowship is to complete an English-language translation of the Traditions, currently available only through an out-of-print edition that is full of errors and lacking in substantial annotation. The translation will result in a book manuscript and additionally, will be incorporated into a larger project, The Traditions of Exemplary Women: A Digital Research Collection. The research collection is a bilingual-multimedia resource for scholarly inquiry into the complex relationship between representations of women in early China and the cultural forces that shaped them. To move the project forward, the most crucial activity at this stage is to complete the translation (chapters 3-8), which will then become the cornerstone of the larger project. As a resource for discovering and establishing new relationships between text, geography, genealogies, images, people, philosophical movements, events and themes, the digital research collection will not only help extend the boundaries of humanistic research in this field but will also suggest new ways for sinologists to translate and annotate texts, formulate questions, and engage in research. By making all of its resources bilingual, the project, and especially, the translation, also promises to open up the culture of early China to scholars who know no Chinese.</p>",

I am requesting an NEH fellowship to write a book, Truth and Existence, in which I argue that the Received View is flawed. And once it is repaired, I argue, it is no longer fit to be a non-question-begging test for theories.

I then reconsider the theories attacked by the Received View. Along the way, we gain a variety of insights into each of the theories discussed.</p>",

For three quarters of a century (1852-1920) Uncle Tom's cabin remained continually part of the national consciousness as not just a best-selling book, but also through the numerous responses and adaptations it generated: in newspapers and books, on stage, on film, and so on. In this larger cultural sense, the novel served as a central site for Americans to express and argue their ideas about race and slavery, history and religion. The digital archive locates the novel's text in this crucial larger cultural matrix by finding and identifying these ancillary materials and publishing them digitally as sgml texts, high-quality images and multi-media files. We are requesting NEH support to complete the main archival construction phase of the project by digitizing the complete record of the anti-Tom novels of the 1850s, the Southern newspaper response 1852-1865, the children's book adaptations 1890-1930, the transformation of the novel into Tom Shows after 1875, and the history of its adaptation into a series of silent movies between 1903-1927.</p>",

Students can explore every dimension of the conflict and write their own histories, reconstructing the life stories of women, African Americans, farmers, politicians, soldiers, and families. The project is intended for secondary schools, community colleges, and universities. W.W. Norton and Co. has committed to publish 3 interactive CD-ROMs, the first of which focuses on the coming of the Civil War. That disc has been designed for the educational market and is priced much lower than previous history software. We are seeking support from the NEH to create the second and third CDs, devoted to the war years and their aftermath.</p>",

Despite accelerating concern about misues of valuable natural resources and despite general awareness that short-comings in allocative laws have contributed to that misuse, few legal scholars have devoted major effort to improving the social performance of allocative law. Economics can provide law-makers with an informing theory of allocation and practical guidance in concrete allocation cases. Modern property law teachers agree that major effort must be directed at bringing the student to a solid understanding not only of social and political role which private ownership of goods plays in national life but also of role which government can play in increasing social yield of resources. Because legal rules rarely indicate social needs, students must look to the adjacent social sciences.
