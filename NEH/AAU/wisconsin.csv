<p>This study argues that the development of urban theatre as a secular, competitive, artistic institution in colonial and postcolonial India exemplifies in uniquely complex ways the “alternative modernity” of cultural forms in the Global South. Given India’s long precolonial history of multilingual literacy and indigenous performance, the modernizing force of Anglo-European influences created aesthetic, material, and institutional conditions for theatre after 1850 that were historically unprecedented and culturally transformative, but still affected by the legacies of “tradition.” The new initiatives included the resurgence of classical Sanskrit models, print authorship, large-scale translation, anti-commercialism, and the formation as well as subversion of a “new national canon” after independence (1947-). My project thus delineates the evolving modernity of a major non-Western urban theatre field, connecting it to sociocultural shifts in India and to vital movements in world theatre.</p>",

One of its main innovations is that it will examine non-quantitative notions of infinity in the early modern period alongside quantitative notions, and clarify how they are different.

Berlin’s strength lay instead in its capacity for musical “re-creation,” pursued in performance outlets of “high” and “low” culture, educational institutes, and music industries. My book takes an interdisciplinary approach to investigate Berlin’s musical life from the reign of Wilhelm II to the building of the Berlin Wall.

PodcastRE Analytics leverages the 120,000+ podcasts of the PodcastRE database (http://podcastre.org), a preservation collaboration between UW-Madison’s Libraries and Dept. of Communication Arts, to pioneer new techniques for the analysis and visualization of audio and metadata. While tools for data mining text archives exist, PodcastRE Analytics will allow users to explore audio in ways that are as familiar as textual resources.

<p>Standard logic deals with statements, like “the door is open,” not with imperatives, like “open the door”. Just as statements follow from other statements (e.g., “the door is open” follows from “the door and the window are open”), imperatives follow from other imperatives (e.g., “open the door” follows from “open both the door and the window”). In standard logic, a conclusion follows from a premise if the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In imperative logic, one cannot say this, since imperatives cannot be true or false. So what is it for an imperative conclusion to follow from an imperative premise? In a series of publications, I have proven several theorems which provide a novel answer to this question. My project is to make these results more widely accessible by organizing them into a book. This project is important because logic deals with the foundations of correct reasoning, and correct reasoning is essential in every field, including the humanities.</p>",

<p>Publication of Volume V of DARE was a huge milestone, but not the end of the work, for American English has changed greatly in the last 50 years. DARE proposes to initiate new fieldwork, from July 2013 to June 2015, to track those changes. Using Wisconsin as a pilot, the project will develop a web-based survey to gather the data. Based on the results, adjustments will be made to the methodology before a nationwide survey is attempted. The research will include large parts of the original Questionnaire plus questions designed to reflect societal changes since the 1960s. The original 22 DARE communities and 18 new ones, representing the current state population, will be surveyed. The web based survey will be designed by the UW Survey Center. It will also include a telephone interview with free conversation, the reading of a story, and a word list designed to elicit pronunciation variants. DARE will analyze the data and make changes to the methodology before initiating a nationwide study.</p>",

Yet this intensifying recruitment of writing on a mass scale is little studied nor understood, even, intriguingly, as the NEA and others have reported precipitous declines in reading during the same time period. This study examines the growing rivalry between reading and writing in the lived experience of everyday Americans and the implications of this new and paradoxical chapter in the history of mass literacy. The book explores the implications of a rise in mass writing for a society whose major institutions (as well as its ways of valuing literacy) grew up around the premise that readers would be many and writers would be few.</p>",

<p>Potawatomi, also known as Neshnabémwen, is a critically endangered Algonquian language spoken primarily in the Midwestern United States. At the height of Potawatomi's historical influence and geographical spread in the late 18th century, there were as many as 10,000 speakers in villages surrounding Lake Michigan. Estimates are that 15 or fewer fluent native speakers of this language remain, all in their 70s and 80s. The goals of the project are the documentation and preservation of the language through the compilation of a database of lexical materials from which a bilingual dictionary will be published in both hardcopy and electronic format. The project draws upon a wide variety of written and recorded language documentation that has been collected by missionaries, speakers, students, and scholars over the years and would make these existing materials more generally available, supplementing them with newly collected linguistic data, consolidating them into a database, and producing a dictionary for the first time. A collaborative effort between community language speakers and linguists, the project would benefit Potawatomi language teachers and learners as well as linguists, especially those interested in comparative and historical Algonquian.

Archaeological materials include type-site collections that form the foundation of regional culture histories, while the ethnographic collections include materials no longer produced. In addition to their research significance, these materials are invaluable aids in teaching. The proposed assessment is the first step to bring these collections up to modern standards of curation and make them more accessible to humanities researchers and educators.</p>",

I am investigating how drama as a distinct mode of theatrical representation borrowed many of its central formal conventions and epistemological protocols from what historians of science have termed ""practical knowledge,"" a hybrid mode of understanding based partly on the proto-empirical methods of artisanal workshops and partly on humanist habits of reasoning derived from the fields of classical ethics, rhetoric, and poetics. The book thus describes a convergence between literary and scientific epistemologies in England before the so-called Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century, during the period when both fields were in a crucial moment of formation. To what extent, it asks, might English humanists, literary critics, and playwrights have encountered methods of proto-scientific thinking in part through their interest in poetics and the arts of language, even as poetics itself, and especially the public drama, derived some of its fundamental concepts and methods from contemporary technical fields? In method the project extends the work of new historicist and cultural materialist critics, historians of the theater, and scholars of print culture by examining the drama in its various social and economic conditions; it departs from previous work, however, by advocating a renewed attention to the methods of intellectual history: to the epistemological, as well as social, contexts of the drama, and particularly to the way that concepts basic to the field of literary criticism emerged during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>",

The Telugu tradition is one of the richest and most lyrical of all Indian literatures, and also one of the least known outside of its own territory. This project seeks to introduce the major classical poets in Telugu to an English-speaking audience, to situate them in terms of the internal evolution of the tradition, and to annotate and illuminate their poetry in the light of the major thematic concerns of Telugu culture. An introduction will discuss the thousand-year history of Telugu poetry and poetics and the major breakthroughs and revolutions it has undergone.

New excavations will focus on areas of the site where large samples of craft indicators and inscribed objects can be recovered from pre-urban occupation levels. Contextual and chronological analysis, formal and stylistic studies, iconological studies, and technological analysis will be conducted. This research will be of considerable interest to scholars studying early urbanism, technological change, the origins of writing, state level society, and ""world"" economic systems.</p>",
