Our week-long 2022 Dickens Universe will bring non-academic participants (ranging from high school students to senior citizens) together with Black studies and Victorian studies scholars to examine how 19th-century novels can sharpen our awareness of racist assumptions that underpin many of the structures that still organize our world today.  In concert with the Universe, our two high school programs will both use creative lesson plans and projects to help students make connections between portrayals of racism and poverty in 19th-century fiction and their own experiences of 21st-century inequality.</p>",

Unlike, say, penicillin, these new treatments didn’t just cure diseases — they held out the promise of enlarging the very boundaries of the human. It was a utopian future that never arrived. In its place came the past that we now remember: transformative pills refigured either as prosaic “mother’s little helpers” or as stigmatized drugs; the ploughshares of an idealistic postwar moment beaten back into swords.

<p>This study explores a critical question in political theory and postcolonial studies, namely: How can we envision political progress in the postcolonial world after the heyday of decolonization? What intellectual and practical resources do we have for theorizing the role of political agency after the demise of the revolutionary ideologies that gave a central role to that agency (e.g., of the nation, the working class, etc.), and the rise of post-independence states that seek to quell it? I address these questions by closely examining the oeuvres of three prominent political thinkers who lived and wrote in the postcolonial Arab world, and whose works heavily influenced intellectual debates about political change from the late 1980s till the eve of the Arab Spring in the 2000s. I shows how each of these thinkers variously defines the conditions for invigorating political agency by actively reinterpreting the Islamic tradition and European political thought for a postcolonial context.</p>",

As a refugee, he then moved to Nova Scotia and finally to the British colony of Sierra Leone for emancipated slaves. Since George’s life spanned the revolutionary era, his story offers a counterpoint to the many biographies of America’s white founders. Instead of typical narratives about political freedom from British monarchy, George’s life presents a parallel quest for freedom from American slavery. To achieve his own independence, George fled the U.S. at its creation.

To this end, my book will offer an introduction to Cassirer’s philosophical system as a whole that enables readers to navigate between his theoretical, cultural, and practical philosophy. Unlike the other books about Cassirer on offer, my book will be at once comprehensive in coverage, broadly accessible but rigorous, up-to-date with the new wave of Cassirer scholarship, and sympathetic to the continuing value of Cassirer’s ideas. This book will be of interest not only to philosophers, but also to undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty working in other fields including anthropology, history, art history, cultural studies, linguistics, and science studies.</p>",

By 1300 most had been expelled from their homelands, except for Spanish Muslims, who persevered forced conversion in 1525, before their expulsion in 1615. Through these centuries, colonized Muslims were deeply embroiled in both their Christian host societies and with local Jewish minorities, and continued to form part of a larger Islamic world. They had a tremendous impact on the development of European culture, society, and identity, and their experiences also comprise an important chapter of Islamic history. This project surveys their communities and analyzes the impact of Christian domination, reciprocal influences of the majority and minority, and their influence on Latin society and culture. A diverse range of methodological approaches will illuminate not only the history of the Muslims of Latin Christendom, but the nature of ethnic and confessional identity and majority-minority relations in general.</p>",

The Institute will focus on the Mediterranean as a zone where Christians, Muslims, and Jews came into contact, in peace as well as in war. This interaction made the Mediterranean region a forum for intellectual and cultural innovation and exchange, the dissemination of which was key in the emergence of the modern West. Our goal is once again to bring together a diverse group of scholars whose research and teaching would, as in 2008, benefit from and contribute to a reformulated understanding of the Mediterrean's role in the development of modernity.</p>",

Two world fairs bookend the period under consideration: the Panama-Pacific Exposition (1915) and the Golden Gate Exposition (1939). This period saw a changing aesthetic--from the emulation of East Coast culture to a more distinctive regional style embracing the area's inherent multiculturalism. In the immediate post-quake period, European-influenced arts predominated: the symphony and opera were founded, while a burgeoning jazz scene was stifled and Chinese opera (the colorful language of San Francisco's largest ethnic minority) languished. However, by the 1930s, San Francisco--which now rivaled New York in the new music scene--featured an experimentalism that included diverse traditions, particularly those of Asia. In 1940 American composer Henry Cowell praised an emerging local style fueled by individualism and cultural integration. This book will trace such changing aesthetic priorities, focusing on subcultures and their interactions. (Edited by staff.)</p>",

Proposed edition has three purposes: (1) to reexamine questions of attribution raised and tentatively resolved by Wallenskold(who did edition in 1921); (2) to review the latter's edition critique in light of more recent developments in the field of romance linguistics; and (3) to incorporate facsimiles and transcriptions of the melodies accompanying the poems. This edition will be a valuable resource in the study of the development of the lyric tradition in the major western vernacular literatures.</p>",
