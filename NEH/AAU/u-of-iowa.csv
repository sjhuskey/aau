Further, we propose to develop an undergraduate curriculum that will flourish in the envisioned workspace. The heart of the curricular proposal is a new introductory course in global print cultures, paired with an existing course on global manuscript cultures. Our goals are threefold: 1) to create and sustain spaces where students learn how material texts from diverse cultural traditions were made; 2) by integrating hands-on making into students’ education, to deepen their understanding of key humanities themes, such as the interpretation of texts and how humans transform, reinterpret, and sustain artifacts and ideas over time and across cultures; & 3) to strengthen the humanities at Iowa by building collaborative connections between faculty, curators, book artists, engineers, scientists, and librarians teaching with material texts across the university.</p>",

This project explores the relationships between medical professionals, populist leaders, and popular culture by relating the story of Dr. Fernando Asuero. In 1929, Asuero captivated Spain and Latin America with the claim that he could relieve pain, even cure paralysis, just by touching the trigeminal nerve. As thousands flocked to Asuero for relief, he and his cure became a transnational cultural phenomenon. The populist rulers of Spain, Italy, and Argentina were among Asuero’s admirers, but the medical establishments of those countries reacted harshly, arguing that he was a quack who should be arrested. The resulting book will make important contributions to the medical humanities by documenting how doctors, patients, and politicians were portrayed in transnational popular culture, to the history of the politicization of medicine, and to the history of medical professionalization in Spain and Latin America.</p>",

In redefining music as movement, the book argues that sign language music, rather than being marginal or extraneous to histories and theories of music, is in fact central and crucial to our understanding of all musical expression and experience.

The practice may seem bizarre, but it&nbsp;had enormous consequences. When criminal minstrels donned their disguise, they were purposefully trying to frame black people for their crimes and often did so successfully. They were also drawing upon larger racist ideas about race and crime—in particular, pseudoscientific theories of African Americans as innately criminally prone. Their actions in turn provoked an array of responses, from NAACP investigations to furious editorials to condemnations&nbsp;by anti-lynching activists who argued that such acts provoked racial violence.

The goal of the grant is to support a preservation assessment of the approximately 700 items in the textile collections of the University of Iowa Museum of Art.

<p>Arctic material collected by Frank Russell in 1892-1894 and by Vilhjalmur Stefansson in 1908-1912 is among the highlights of the University of Iowa Museum of Natural History&rsquo;s collections. The Arctic ethnographic collections contain over 1,500 artifacts, including ivory, beadwork, tools, clothing, weapons, ornaments, and other objects representing cultures such as Cree, Athabascan, Inuit, and Dog Rib. They are an important resource for research and education about the ethnography, history, and art of northern peoples in North America. The collections are currently housed in a mix of new and old cabinets or on open shelving with poor environmental control. Some objects lack individual supports, causing degradation in storage and making handling them more difficult. This project will create individual supports and enclosures for objects and upgrade cabinets, aiding long-term preservation and protecting the collection from continued deterioration.<br /> </p>",

Our seminar focuses on the implications of postsecular studies for our understanding of the English Novel (1719-1897). Literary scholars have traditionally seen the rise of the novel as a clear sign of secularization. Although there are good reasons for this, as we will acknowledge, religion does not disappear in 18th- and 19th-century fiction, and we need to expand our histories and theories of the novel to better understand the changing roles played by religion in modernity. Following the classic NEH seminar format, our four-week seminar will meet three mornings a week to discuss six representative novels and a range of interdisciplinary work on postsecular studies. Through shared conversations, the seminar will provide a stimulating environment to participants' individual projects on related topics.</p>",

Tunisia contains some of finest and most important mosaics of Roman Empire, providing richest documentation available for history of Roman painting. Utica chosen as first area of concentration because of its prominent economic and social position in antiquity.

Project combined research in American and European libraries and museums with field work in Tunisia. Field work involved cleaning, drawing and photographing mosaics; study and recording of physical and compositional relationship between mosaics and architectural settings. Under first grant, nearly all mosaics in and from Utica recorded. Present project to complete mosaic recording, analysis of archeological and architectlural data, photographic file and moasic preservation. Resulting publication will provide data for full historical art historical interpretation for each moasic. Of importance to art historians because these mosaics reflect stylistic changes and cross-currents in transition period from antiquity to middle ages; thus, provide information on social, intellectual and religious history of Roman era.

Preliminary research conducted during 1967-68 as a Faculty Research Fellow of the American Institute of Indian Studies. Since much of the knowledge of ancient India is derived from artistic monuments, the art historian can potentially contribute much valuable information toward the reconstruction of the heritage of India's past. In addition to being a major formative period of Indian art, the Satavahana period saw the expansion of Buddhism into a truly international religion and the spread of writing and other benefits of Indian civilization to the backward societies of Southeast Asia. </p>",
