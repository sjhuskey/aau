<p><em>Model Machines</em> explores the ways Asians and Asian Americans have been construed as robotic machines in history, from the 19th century to the 21st century. As the first historical monograph on this topic, it mines the ideological work behind the trope of what I am calling the ""model machine."" This stereotype and myth, I argue, shaped public perceptions and policies, determining the treatment of Asians as objects or things to be exploited, excluded, or exterminated. By tracking this technocultural figure across time and space, I interrogate the operations of racial capitalism behind the Western gaze. The book offers case studies concerning the representation of Chinese coolies as ""labor machines,"" Japanese soldiers as ""war machines,"" Asian women as ""sex machines,"" Asian new capitalists and migrants as ""virtual machines"" and Asian neoliberal workers as ""global machines.""

<p>During World War II, photographs and newsreels documenting death and destruction in theaters of war around the world prompted a change in painted representations of landscape in the United States. As a well-established genre in American art, landscape painting had a long tradition of celebrating the local, both bucolic settings and topographical wonders. The wider geographic scope of World War II challenged the regional focus of American landscape painting, especially as it had been practiced in the 1930s. My book examines the ways in which artists struggled to acknowledge an environment now understood to be global and interconnected, and also felt compelled to address the sheer scale of carnage caused by the war. Together these artists recast the terms of landscape painting, broadening its scope from the local to the international, and from the pastoral to the anti-pastoral.</p>",

But forest reclamation in Korea was far from benevolent: it siphoned off forests to Japanese corporations, cut off communities from resources that had long sustained them, and placed vast stands of timber under state control. Afforestation, in other words, was a process rife with conflict and fraught with contradiction. By chronicling this intensive, contested, and largely forgotten forestry project, this book offers a path-breaking case study in the promise and perils of natural resource management in Japan’s empire.</p>",

<p>I propose to re-examine currently orthodox philosophical views concerning the logic, metaphysics and semantics of identity and necessity. The resulting alternative theory dispenses with the notion of a two-place relation that every object bears to itself, and to itself only, and proposes a more sophisticated conception of logical form for necessity statements that accounts, by way of explicit notation, for the distinction between indicative and non-indicative verb moods. It will be shown that a number of prominent philosophical theses, many of which were first articulated by Saul Kripke in the 1970s, require substantial revision or become outright untenable when the background logical framework is modified in the manner proposed. These include the necessity of identity, the existence of contingent a priori truths, and the principled non-synonymy of proper names with definite descriptions.

<p>The development of an undergraduate seminar on conceptions of time in physics, philosophy, fiction, and film. James Weatherall, assistant professor of philosophy at the University of California, Irvine, develops a course to consider What is time? from the perspectives of physics, philosophy, fiction, and film. As its title suggests, this course approaches the question of time as a humanistic inquiry, surveying traditional Chinese philosophy, Abrahamic theology, Ancient Greek philosophy, Kantian and modern philosophy, historical and current physics, and the modern novel. The goal of the course is twofold: to engage students in multiple perspectives on the human conception of time, and to highlight for them critical tensions between the representation of time in the physical sciences and in literature and the arts. The course is divided into two parts. The first part investigates the physics and metaphysics of time; students read selections from Plato's Timaeus, Aristotle's Physics, Augustine's Confessions, Newton's Scholium on Time and Space, Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, and Einstein's Theory of Relativity. In addition, discussion of early Taoist and Zen Buddhist writings on time are paired with the screening of the film Groundhog Day. The second part of the course explores the depiction of time as a subjective experience in fiction, film, and psychology. Readings include James Joyce's Ulysses; excerpts from Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain; Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse; Thomas Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49; Vladimir Nabokov's Ada, or Ardor; and Ernst Pöppel's Mindworks. Students write two essays for the course and participate in a weekly online discussion board.

<p>Walter Benjamin's career extended from the end of the First World War to the beginning of the second. In contrast to figures like Freud, Heidegger, or Foucault who enjoyed widespread recognition and influence during their lifetime, Benjamin's significance as a theorist and writer only came after his death. But like them, Benjamin may be characterized, in Foucault's words, as one of the ""initiators of discursive practices,"" authors who ""produced not only their own work, but the possibility and the rules of formation of other texts."" What is more, Benjamin's reputation has been singularly colored by a legendary 'afterlife.' Admittedly, the 'legend' of a writer should not supersede the interpretation of the works, but neither may it be ignored in evaluating their historical impact. It represents an indispensable index of cultural-political currents at a given moment.</p>",

Poets abandoned earlier commitments to poetry as tracing the encounter with the world and turned inward to see poetry as a revelation of the self. During this period, Neo-Confucian thinkers began to rethink the understanding of this self and its relationship with ethical universals and to the world of transient experience. Poets also engaged in the Neo-Confucian movement, and poetic and philosophical debates merged. To understand the interaction, I propose a model of the literary as aesthetic experience of language that draws on Kant's understanding of aesthetic judgments as intuitions of ordering without immediate conceptual content. Literary history, in this view, traces the difficulties of aesthetic experience that both founds and negates the conceptual content of texts.</p>",
