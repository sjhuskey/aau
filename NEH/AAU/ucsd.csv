<p>The war against stateless peoples (1550-1590) in America’s first borderlands—New Spain’s emerging near northern silver mining district—devastated nomadic indigenous populations (generically called Chichimecas). Traditional native hunting and foraging lands experienced intense ecological change and native men and women were killed or sold into long-term enslavement. Worn down by years of violence and deprivation, native peoples gradually submitted to Spanish rule in the late 1580s, agreeing to resettlement in reducciones (reservations) near Spanish towns. The focus on state peoples and events casts Iberians and sedentary indigenous migrants from central Mexico as the main subjects of this foundational borderlands history. This book recovers and repositions Chichimecas as central protagonists. It considers how they experienced the war, took an active role in peacemaking, responded to social reorganization in reducciones, and navigated the state’s attempts to transform their lifeways.</p>",

Based on a series of empirically rich case studies, the project analyzes the shifting objects of fear and anxiety, as well as the changing norms governing the experience and expression of these emotions. A synthetic analysis draws these cases together to offer a unique perspective on the development of the Federal Republic&mdash;one that underlines the importance of emotions for understanding the process of historical change.

In this highly precarious time, nations and peoples around the world used sport to promote their political, social, and economic development. The media promoted mega-events between capitalist and Communist athletes as surrogates for diplomatic and military tension. Yet, for all its obvious ideological freighting, sport in this period reflected a complex integration of commerce, celebrity, trans-regional and trans-national fan loyalties. It revealed different and shifting notions of race, class and gender (often within a single nation), and the uneasy mapping of sports and geopolitical allegiances could even make bitter rivals of strategic partners.</p>",

To better understand social polarization in Kenya I emphasize the political underpinnings of communal clashes and focus on the culture of political engagement in Kenya’s Coast Province since the 1960s. My research suggests that since the late colonial era political elites have posed identity group cohesion as a primary means of addressing grievances around issues such as land and the inequitable distribution of wealth.

Rohwer and Jerome each imprisoned a peak wartime population of 8,500; these were the only War Relocation Authority (WRA) camps in the American South and the only to house Hawaiians of Japanese descent. The wartime internment in general has not entered most Americans' consciousness. The popularity of interactive role-playing games (RPGs) presents an effective pedagogical medium to capture public interest: by creating a historically accurate RPG reenacting 1944 Arkansas, DRAMA IN THE DELTA will engage the problem-solving behaviors of ""gamers,"" and use this active learning environment to teach about civil liberties--struggles that were eventually triumphant.</p>",

My account emphasizes three distinctive claims. First, I reject ATOMISM, or the view that the proper analysis of responsibility proceeds from analysis of the characteristics of agents, isolated from the social and physical contexts of action. I argue that responsible agency is partly constituted by social and psychological contexts. Second, I reject MONISM about free will, or the view that there is some single capacity or structure of agency that marks responsible agency. Instead, I argue that such agency is constituted by a varied set of capacities, picked out by our diverse practical interests in ascribing responsibility. Finally, I argue for REVISIONISM, the idea that an adequate theory of responsibility will depart from some parts of common sense. Together, these ideas provide a new framework for resolving ancient and recent problems of responsibility.</p>",

Wolf points out that ""[o]ne of the major tasks facing students of the Chinese family is to map the distribution of marriage forms in late traditional times."" (A. Wolf. and Huang 1980). Two decades have passed, but little has been done to explore how marriage patterns diversified and took shape in late imperial history. My project will take up these issues, concentrating on highly differentiated marriage behavior and human interactions surrounding marriages. It will examine not only the diversity of marriage and complexity of social relationships but also the dynamics of gender relations and human emotions that shape the journey of marital life. The project will challenge the conventional marriage paradigm that makes broad assumptions about normative marriage behavior. I will detail various marriage patterns-uxorilocal marriage, little daughter-in-law marriage, cousin marriage, and spirit marriage--looking at how different forms of marriage functioned and how they were constructed and understood. Furthermore, I will question the assumption that in traditional China a woman was denied support from both her natal and marital families and that she enjoyed no conjugal affection and intimacy. I will explore marriage as a gendered personal experience, looking at how gender values and emotions intersected in marriage practices. Arguing that the modernist view of ""love marriage"" is not appropriate for analyzing marriage in late imperial China, I will explore cultural practices, such as the presentation of betrothal gifts, the making of dowries by girls themselves, the exchange of poems between husbands and wives, for contemporary understandings of conjugal love, among men and women.</p>",

During this period, an increasing number of young women responded to the death of a fiancé either by living as if they were widows, or by committing suicide to follow their fiancés to the grave. This research examines the tensions and controversy surrounding the cult. Focusing on the emotions, beliefs, psychology, and lives of the faithful maidens, it seeks to answer the questions of what shaped the gender identity of these young women and how honor, duty, love, and sexuality were perceived and expressed by them. A case study on young women, this project will challenge us to rethink the meanings of love, duty, and sexuality from a cross-cultural perspective.</p>",
