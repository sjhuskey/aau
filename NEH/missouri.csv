This 700-page volume is part of the 24-volume Oxford Edition of the Writings of Alexander Pope being published by Oxford University Press. For this most canonical poet, Miscellany Poems features non-canonical perspectives. It contains poems Pope deliberately excluded from authorized collections, instead allowing them to circulate anonymously in printed and manuscript texts. My edition will clarify which poems Pope wrote and how he revised them. It will also explain the meaning and significance of particular words and phrases, and will provide a reliable and authoritative edition that scholars will use for years to come.  Editorial work is foundational to humanistic study, giving scholars the opportunity to bridge historical and cultural gaps. Bridging such gaps is always difficult, but scholarly editions bring us into closer contact with past writers and thinkers.</p>",

The Albanian-speaking community in the Black Sea region of Turkey was originally formed by migrants from the Sancak of Nish (an Ottoman administrative unit north of the contemporary boundaries of Kosovo) who were forced into Kosovo in 1878 and who subsequently fled from there to the inner Ottoman Empire, especially between 1912-1914. The community has been isolated from other Albanian communities since. All the Albanian speakers are also fluent in Turkish. Documenting a Turkish variety of Albanian will add to our pool of data about Modern Albanian, and increase our knowledge of the historical development of Albanian and its dialects. In addition to being significant to Albanian linguistics, the data and texts collected will be made available to language scholars in general thus adding to our corpus of structures found in modern language which must be accounted for by general linguistic theory.

Our study of Irish religious demography, 1659-1926, reveals that Irish history is much more complex than that binary model suggests. By charting the shifting boundaries between Irish Protestants and Catholics, we show that, especially in Ulster, economic and political conflict within the Protestant community was often the primary factor in shaping Irish society. Thus, our study suggests that better understanding Ireland's past may point to a less polarized future.</p>",

Additionally, the data from the old survey notes will be analyzed toward the construction of a historical model of the cultural and natural landscapes of Missouri. All of the resultant information will be disseminated to the public through CD production and MSDIS (Missouri Spatial Data Information Service - http://msdis.missouri.edu). Finally, and importantly, this project plans to publish these findings through the collaborative efforts of the University of Missouri Press, Dr. Walter A. Schroeder, Dr. Mark C. Cowell, and Mr. James D. Harlan. The prospective book title is THE HISTORICAL LANDSCAPES OF MISSOURI.</p>",

Examining the careers of these women not only illuminates one of the most important eras in U.S. theatre history but also leads inevitably to an investigation of race and gender ideology in American culture. This study will contribute to our understanding of American social history as well as theatre history, at the same time reinforcing the important connection between the two.</p>",

Americans today concerned with power of the presidency, responsiveness of Congress, role of courts, and other problems relating to the functioning of a democratic government. In seeking to achieve a clearer understanding of the process of government, American political history is essential to understanding nation's current institutions and habits of thought.

The relationship of literature and science in the eighteenth century has not received the attention it deserves; recent studies indicate that science and empirical methodology were central to the intellectual thought of the period. In an age when human experience and human knowledge were treated as a whole, rather than in terms of narrow specializations, men of letters were constantly aware of the political, social, philosophical, theological, and literary implications of the ""new philosophy"" of science. Study focuses on Johnson's knowledge of and writings on science, his views of Baconian science, and his attempts to provide justification and encouragement of science on the basis of humanistic and religious principles. Fellow has previously written articles on Johnson and edited Samuel Johnson's Medical Biographies to be published in The Sources of Science series. </p>",
