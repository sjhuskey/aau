Supreme Court’s evolving relationship to the political system across the nineteenth century.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today most Americans believe the Supreme Court should remain outside of partisan politics. But in the 1830s, when partisanship became central to American life, justices were deeply enmeshed in the political system. These men conducted judicial work while actively politicking outside their chambers—building partisan coalitions, campaigning on behalf of state and federal officials, even running for political office themselves. This project investigates why the Supreme Court’s relationship to politics changed from these early years. It argues that by the end of the century, as partisan politics grew more complex and geographically dispersed, justices were increasingly unable to exert political influence from their positions on the Court. To bolster their power, justices instead began to describe themselves in apolitical ways and to advocate for a stronger judiciary; they no longer sought to influence national politics through partisan activity, but by judicial decision-making itself.</p>",

<p>Radical Democracy in Germany, 1871-1918, focuses on resistance to a patently undemocratic system. The project examines center-left reformers, socialists, feminists, and proponents of gay rights who between 1871 and the state’s demise at the end of the First World War profoundly altered the autocratic structure of the German Empire. While being targeted by the country’s authorities this study’s subjects pushed back against a system designed to protect small social and economic elites. They demanded reforms of gerrymandered franchise procedures; of sexual and gender norms; and of Germany’s nationalist and imperialist foreign and economic policies. The book highlights the potential for democratic change even under undemocratic conditions, and the chances taken or squandered by the champions of democratic reform in Germany before 1918. As such, it exposes understudied moments of historical contingency and tells stories of what was and suggests futures of what could have been.</p>",

<p>Seasonal Tastes investigates poetic style, culinary flavor, and the construction of diurnal time in early modern English literary works and practical handbooks.

Likewise, “taste” referred both to bodily sensation and readerly pleasure; the consumption of food as well as a discerning appetite for literary culture. Seasonal Tastes puts literary works and “how to” literature in dialogue to explore flavor, time, literary form, and climate in the early modern period. This project intervenes in debates about how nature is depicted within literary studies, and within the humanities more broadly, by taking seasons as its central focus.</p>",

<p>“Seeing Constable’s Clouds” proposes to use computer vision and machine learning to better understand the visual cues of 19th-century pictorial realism. Realist landscapes by British artist John Constable (1776-1837) are often split into two phases depending on whether they were made before or after an intense period spent observing and painting clouds in 1821-1822. Contemporaries disagreed about the effect this interlude had on the realism of his work, and art historians continue to debate how his empirical approach influenced his style and technique. The project team will use computer vision to seek formal details that art historians may have overlooked or been unable to discern. We will also use machine learning to discover whether there are formal features that contribute to the verisimilitude of three different types of pictorial realism: Constable’s paintings of clouds, fine art photographs of clouds, and research photographs of clouds made for scientific study.</p>",

It looks at a range of events and individuals involved with the McClellan Committee hearings, the largest investigation of labor racketeering in U.S. history. The investigation began in 1956, in the wake of a horrific acid attack on the crusading anti-racketeering newspaper columnist, Victor Riesel. Participants in the probe drew on their previous experience investigating the menace of internal communism. A close working relationship between the news media and the committee staff shaped the revelations of the hearings. Both organized labor and its opponents invoked a discourse of anti-racketeering in debates over union power, but the McClellan Committee hearings undercut the public's view of the labor movement's legitimacy.

<p>Born in Concord, Massachusetts on the eve of the American Revolution, Mary Moody Emerson (1774-1863) was a self-educated scholar, theologian, and author whose intellectual production bridges the 18th and 19th centuries. Most widely known as the brilliant aunt of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Mary Emerson influenced her nephew's work and published her own pseudonymous essays; her most significant accomplishment is a series of unpublished manuscripts she called ""Almanacks"" (c. 1804-1855). Spanning over fifty years and one thousand pages, these documents feature characteristics of the spiritual diary, philosophical commonplace book, and epistolary essay and demonstrate the ways in which early American women adapted traditionally ""masculine"" genres and subject matter. The editors are collaborating with the director and staff of the Brown University Women Writers Project to publish a scholarly digital edition of the complete Almanacks in their subscription database, Women Writers Online.</p>",

In a recent book, I described slave neighborhoods at length in Mississippi, where the neighborhood terrain comprised adjoining places, and sketched neighborhoods across the South. In Nat Turner's Confessions, one of the most widely read slave narratives, Turner described the rebellion he led as a neighborhood enterprise. Yet historians have yet to elaborate on the neighborhood leitmotif in the Confessions.

Hemingway's pioneering contributions to twentieth-century American literature made a profound and lasting impact on modern English-language prose style, and to this day, his life and work command enormous popular as well as scholarly interest worldwide. The letters represent the last frontier of Hemingway studies. In addition to providing new biographical and artistic insights into the achievement of this most influential American writer, the letters constitute a running eyewitness account and cultural history of much of the twentieth century. The edition, accepted for publication by the Cambridge University Press, will be published in twelve volumes over the next fourteen years.
