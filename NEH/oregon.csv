The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the ability of both institutes to carry out their work, which is primarily accomplished through in-person trainings. In the past year, both programs have pivoted toward online learning and on-demand trainings to continue a modified version of normal operations, expand program accessibility, and meet the varying needs of program participants.

<p>This book looks at the relationship between vocal delivery and song form in rock and pop songs since 1991. The project challenges the traditional opposition between sound and structure, arguing instead that in this repertoire, sound&nbsp;<em>creates</em> structure. Put another way, rock and pop singers are composing with their voices. In arguing for voice-based composition, I propose a new ontology for popular song that centers the human element, conceiving of a song not as an abstract collection of notes, chords, and words but as the direct statement of a singing persona, one whose voice communicates not only a lyrical message but also corporeality, emotional states, and social identity. Treating sound and voice not as so-called “secondary parameters” but as primary aspects of a popular song expands what counts as musical structure and recasts traditional notions of what gives music its value, which may help finally put to rest the tired notion that popular music is musically simplistic.</p>",

the only – Asian American literary anthology to achieve the status of trade

By examining the harmful consequences of the declaration of San Basilio de Palenque's Afro-descendant culture as ""Intangible Heritage of Humanity"" by UNESCO, I trace how heritage policy ends up perpetuating, against declared intention, the inequalities that multicultural policies intend to resolve.

Taking as its corpus eleven epic poems written in the Italian vernacular between 1596 and 1650, my book considers the relationship between baroque epic poetry and local politics; between Italian poems about the Americas and Spanish colonialism; and between literary production and emerging notions of Italian identity.  A principal argument of this study is that the heated debates about representing Columbus and Vespucci as epic heroes inevitably point to concerns about Europe’s global expansion and Italy’s role in that expansion. This project sheds light on texts that have not received adequate attention in studies of early modern European colonialism and in scholarship on the reception of the Americas in seventeenth-century Italy.</p>",

The dominance of television and radio programming in Spanish, departures from the Tsachila enclaves for employment reasons, increasing intermarriage with the wider population, and Spanish language instruction in schools have resulted in the narrowing of Tsafiki language use to addressing elders within the community. The project has four interrelated goals: 1) web-based distribution of an electronic lexical database of approximately 10,000 words with standard dictionary information (e.g., definitions in Tsafiki, Spanish, and English; examples with translations; pronunciation guides; and grammatical category information), encyclopedic information, pictures, and sound files, 2) completion of the archiving of some 200 hours of translated and transcribed video and audio files in the Netherlands and at the University of Texas at Austin, 3) completion of a comprehensive, descriptive grammar of Tsafiki, and 4) completion of a manuscript describing verbal classification systems in Tsafiki, to be published by Brill.

We will also provide Spanish translations that bilingual speakers can offer and access through an additional online interface. To this modern Nahuatl written material we will add Classical examples, extracting attestations from recently published colonial manuscripts and studies of the same, with their Spanish and English translations and commentaries. It is our sincere goal to bridge the gap between Modern and Classical Nahuatl and bolster native speakers' literacy and access to the unparalleled cultural legacy that potentially thousands of manuscripts written in Nahuatl can represent.

I argue that this under appreciated transition marked an important moment in the reform of the criminal law, and an even more significant chapter in the rise of humanitarian sensibility. Forgery became a capital crime in the early eighteenth century, and it was the principal offense around which the controversy over the gallows took place after 1800. A study of the treatment of the crime thus illustrates changing penal ideas and offers a way of measuring the impact of evolving notions of property.</p>",

My proposed book about reinforcement of cultural differences in response to transnational migration and globalization will help throw light on contemporary processes of ethnic, national, and local identity formation, definitions of citizenship, and models for achieving cultural and political recognition in diverse nations such as the U.S. and Mexico. Importantly, the social and political actions of indigenous migrants challenge predictions that processes of cultural and economic globalization will result in homogeneity. Moreover, the idea that processes of globalization are top-down is called into question. The two groups examined in this project are: (a) migrants who have come from the Mixtec region of Oaxaca and currently reside in the state of Oregon to work in commercial agriculture and other sectors and are involved in a struggle for cultural recognition, labor rights, and support for their transnational organizations and (b) Zapotec migrants who lived in northern Mexico and California and have returned to their community in rural Oaxaca to form weaving cooperatives in an attempt to gain political and cultural rights in their community and in the global market as independent artisans. This project addresses two primary debates in the humanities. The first is about how globalization affects expressions of cultural difference. The second is on the relationship between migration and processes of place and trans-place forms of ethnic identity construction. More narrowly, this project will help me deepen my scholarly engagement with indigenous Mexican migration and identity formation.</p>",
