institutions ranging from major libraries, museums, and archives to local historical
societies, and professionals from diverse fields such as historians,
librarians, archivists, curators, computer scientists, physical scientists, and
conservators. A critical portion of preservation is in the hands of
conservators. Conservators intimately interact with the works of cultural
heritage or art to restore them to functional use by today’s scholars and
historians. They return works to appropriate aesthetic levels for exhibition
and preserve them for future generations to learn from and appreciate. The
education and training of conservators is an essential component of all
preservation efforts and the Garman Art Conservation Department at the State
University of New York College at Buffalo is fully committed to this goal and

<p>""Living in the Future: The Utopian Strain in the Long Civil Rights Movement"" explores the contributions intentional utopian communities that practiced interracialism, cooperative economics, and nonviolence made to the long civil rights movement. As early as the 1920s there were significant experiments in interracial communalism at labor colleges, folk schools, and urban and rural cooperatives. By the 1940s members of the Congress of Racial Equality and the Fellowship of Reconciliation living in interracial utopian communities began to actively train activists in radical nonviolence. By living cooperatively and communally they were creating a new reality that would serve as a model for civil rights activists. More pragmatically, these communities’ members trained activists and created real change in the economic and political fortunes of African Americans. Their vision of a future with full racial equality and economic justice fueled the utopian strain in the long civil rights movement.</p>",

<p>My book project is a study of Chilean politics in democracy and dictatorship. In the first five chapters, I study how Chileans turned urban and visual culture into important forms of political debate in the post-war period until the military coup of September 11, 1973. In the last, I situate the military junta's violent repression within this longer story of post-war democratic urban politics, revealing that the regime's violence was not an aberration but a brutal attempt to censure the very democratic public spheres and practices that urban residents had developed on the capital city's streets and walls. Paying attention to the material and visual culture of democratic politics, then, also allows us to see that clandestine forms of political resistance drew on post-war political practices (including urban protest, street photography and ephemera) that were re-imagined under the dictatorship.

The relationship between social and physical space and the differences between field and space in Bourdieu’s work are explored. The lens of social space permits investigations of the ways in which people distant in physical space can feel socially close to each other, and vice versa, and of how ideas about social closeness and distance can shape processes of social inclusion and exclusion.

Notably remembered as where Pres. McKinley was assassinated; there is more to the story. Illuminated by 80,000 electric lights, Buffalo was literally transformed into a City of Light.

It will result in (1) the creation of documentary resources in the form of audio and visual recordings; (2) the creation of descriptive materials in the form of transcribed and annotated texts, word lists, and information on their grammars; and (3) an assessment of the possibilities for future documentary work. The field work described in this proposal will take place in the town of Wum. The languages to be included are Bikya, Bishuo, and Busuu. There is, for practical purposes, no existing documentation on any of these; the number of speakers ranges from as many as eight for Busuu to as few as one for Bikya and Bishuo, and Bikya, in fact, may already be extinct. The languages are probably Bantoid but not clearly related to surrounding languages or to each other, making the need to gather information on them before they become extinct especially pressing. The languages provide one of the few sources of evidence for understanding what peoples may have occupied Furu-Awa in the distant past in a region believed to be part of the Proto-Bantu homeland and may offer crucial links between Bantu languages and the rest of the Benue-Congo language group. They may also offer clues into the nature of Bantu expansion itself. (Edited by staff)</p>",

The rare performances of their compositions attracted an eager and curious audience that resisted the regime through its attendance. The project is based on interviews with a large number of participants in this ""unofficial"" musical subculture and thereby supplies a necessary corrective to the sanitized ""official"" version of events that is usually reported by historians.</p>",
