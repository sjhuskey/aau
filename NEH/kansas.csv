<p>Since 2015, when 890,000 refugees arrived in Germany, the state has funded literary initiatives that feature their voices. This project explores how Germany's approach to bringing non-citizens into the public sphere relates to the ways in which the nation has historically prioritized books and reading as tools for developing the ideal citizen--an educated and worldly-wise individual. This research analyzes how state-funded literary projects in Germany's capital, Berlin, invoke this citizenship ideal as they seek to teach citizens about refugees and introduce refugees to German cultural norms. These projects serve the goal of cultural integration, but, as this book argues, they conflate the statuses of citizen, non-citizen, and world citizen, which hold distinct relationships to the state. This study offers key insights into the practice, possibilities, and limitations of literature and the humanities in addressing recent challenges related to the state's obligations of hospitality.</p>",

<p>This monograph recovers French author Christine de Pizan's substantial influence on late medieval English literature, an influence obscured by male writers' failure to cite her properly or at all, due to a combination of misogyny and political rivalries. Using a methodology that attends to gender, translators' practices, and political tensions between England and France, I reorient fifteenth-century English literary culture around Christine as the central figure whose inventive perspectives on authority, gender, war, and politics provided a rich opportunity for English writers to translate, adapt, and react to her ideas. New manuscript evidence reveals that writers such as Hoccleve and Lydgate knew Christine’s works better than their poems disclose, demonstrating that although they prefer to place themselves in the masculine English lineage of Chaucer, they owe many innovations in the form, content, and quality of their writings to the prominent French woman author instead.</p>",

Here, I examine the army’s attempts to manage “race” during the late ‘60s and early ‘70s, exploring the struggles that yielded military justice reform, limited acceptance of cultural symbols (Afros; the dap), race relations education, and affirmative action programs. I show that, despite systemic racism, individuals made a difference, and argue that the army’s “institutional logic”-- the collective force of the army’s culture, history, and tradition, its structure and organization, its avowed mission—determined, to a great extent, how those attempted solutions played out: what would most easily succeed; what would more likely fail.</p>",

University of Kansas Libraries hopes to enlist the consulting services of Image Permanence Institute to develop a sustainability plan for optimizing the current air handling unit and heating-air conditioning system in Spencer Library. IPI consultants will make three site visits to set up, collect, and analyze data from Spencer's air handling unit and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system. The Institute will provide ongoing investigations of mechanical system settings and operations over 18 months, develop suggestions and priorities for optimizing the existing system and improving the preservation quality of Spencer Library's spaces.</p>",

<p>In the proposed course, Ani Kokobobo, assistant professor of Slavic Literatures at the University of Kansas, uses canonical works of nineteenth Russian literature and philosophical works to consider the boundaries of communities through the enduring question: ""Am I my brother's keeper?"" In Russian culture, as reflected in the works of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, community is understood in capacious and almost universalist terms. We focus on the significant moral responsibility these writers believe community members have toward one another and the challenges of upholding these moral responsibilities. Kokobobo pairs the Russian texts with six distinct ethical philosophies-ethical relativism, egoism, consequentialism, deontology, virtue ethics, and feminist ethics. Having honed their ethical vocabularies, students spend the last month of this class applying these skills to thinking about the boundaries of our contemporary American communities, with a special focus on racial divisions.</p>",

The Black Book Interactive Project (BBIP) responds to this critical digital invisibility by proposing to create a metadata schema that accounts for race, to make these archives more discoverable for scholarship. Using 75 novels from the Project on the History of Black Writing digital archive, we will produce a demonstration project that increases access to little known AA texts, encourages and enables text mining as a digital practice, and bridges the current gaps in computational research in literary studies. Our goal is to expand the community of users and practitioners and to make this schema a standard for the interactive exploration of similar digitized collections.</p>",

In the sixty years since Till's murder, only eight years have passed without the case being covered by the New York Times. Scaling Emmett Till uses the constant commemorations of Emmett Till to explore the intersections among race, geography, and memory. It does so by foregrounding the geographic variables in Till’s murder. This book project focuses on the contested murder site, sixty years of inconsistent maps, and, above all, the various geographic regions through which Till’s murder has been given meaning: the state of Mississippi, the Mississippi Delta, and Tallahatchie County. It argues that as the scale of his murder has shifted from the state to the Delta to the county, the basic geographic facts of the case have been altered and the role of race has been called into question.</p>",

It interrogates a selection of post-1989 pseudo-autobiographical novels whose central theme is the recollection of childhood and adolescent experiences in the People's Republic of Poland.

This project examines the impact of new vision technology on verbal imagination by focusing on the thematization of vision in Japanese prose literature of roughly the first quarter of the 20th century, a period coincident with the emergence of a new mechanized visual regime in which magic lanterns, panoramas, cameras, stereoscopes, motion pictures, and mass-produced illustrated magazines led to new experiences of time and space and transformed relationships between viewing subject and object. In an era when technologies of image production are determining relationships between individuals and nations, the need for studies that examine the effects of visual culture upon literary culture is timely and compelling.</p>",

In my study, I aim to show how Ginastera's cinematic works contributed to the human experience by aesthetically inscribing the Argentine search for identity. My work will demonstrate how Ginastera's motion picture music constructed a pastoral trope of the Argentine landscape and how the composer's distinguished North American colleague, Aaron Copland, significantly shaped his work through parallel representations of the American West. To support this project, I request NEH funding to help cover the cost of travel to the Paul Sacher Stiftung in Basel, Switzerland, where Ginastera's film music manuscripts are stored. I will publish my research in an article-length study and a chapter in my forthcoming book on Alberto Ginastera and the musical construction of Argentine pastoral space.</p>",

This project is part of a larger study of the history and development of Tarpeia’s myth over several centuries. Changes in Tarpeia’s representation in art, literature, and ritual offer a useful window into Rome's evolving ideology.</p>",
