<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, Black women writers gained unprecedented visibility in a US cultural marketplace shaped, on the one hand, by the Black Arts Movement’s demand that Black artists represent lived racial experience and, on the other, by the historical white demand that blackness reliably take its appointed form: embodied and spectacular. Yet, even as these contending forces intersected, certain black women writers refused these expectations. Black Anaesthetics: African American Narrative Beyond Man argues that writers such as Toni Morrison, Octavia Butler, and Andrea Lee invented techniques of obscuring blackness to trouble the racial logics requiring that it always be uttered or seen. Studying their narrative racial experiments, Black Anaesthetics tells the story of how their integration of the mainstream publishing world conditioned the development of black anaesthetics, narrative practices figuring blackness as imperceptible, but always in the shadow of the racialized world.</p>",

This two-year project will process and digitize sheet music for silent [mute] film accompaniment in the Mirskey Collection (MC), held by the ULS Theodore M. Finney Music Library. The MC contains approximately 3,000 sets of “photoplay” music, or music published specifically for cinema orchestra, with each set averaging fifteen instrumental parts, for a total of approximately 45,000 pages. Music for silent film accompaniment is an important resource for humanities scholars and musicologists exploring media studies, popular music, historical art music, gendered activities, class and social stratification, and a variety of other areas. Yet, silent film music remains very difficult for scholars and performers to access. The proposed project will preserve the entire MC and make it freely available online for research, performance, public programming, and exhibition.</p>",

<p>Before he died, Benjamin Franklin placed a bet on America. His will's final codicil ordered the deposit of funds to be cashed out, with the accrual of compound interest, by the cities of Boston and Philadelphia 100, then 200, years later - should they still stand. Franklin's wager, a response to a dare by a French writer urging him to show his citizens how to apply Poor Richard's example for posterity, did - remarkably - pay out, funding civic projects and vocational training. Leaving money to beautify cities and fund vocational training - usually credited to the likes of Carnegie and Rockefeller - was yet another of Franklin's inventions, and one all but forgotten today. This book will explain how Franklin was the Founding Father of American philanthropy (he also invented the matching grant), and how his example of small, targeted giving can inform the national conversation as the Baby Boom generation prepares to give away $30 trillion, the largest transfer of wealth in U.S. history.</p>",

I reveal that recruiting appeals made to women as well as to other targeted demographic groups depended more on the surrounding social and political contexts than the recruitment model used to fill military ranks. Advertisements for army service served significant public relations purposes beyond just that of filling ranks. I examine the cultural influence of army advertisements on the civilian public's perceptions, the recruited soldiers' expectations, and the enlisted soldiers' experiences of military service.

My book accounts for how visual priorities complemented musical interests. Beyond the choirbook, I situate these notational practices in a culture of enigmatic writing that saw newfound interest in cryptography, emblems, and hieroglyphs. These examples attest to a widespread fascination with a semiotics of writing that balanced intentional concealment and eventual revelation.

<p>The University of Pittsburgh's Center for Russian and East European Studies (REES) works with up to twenty regular and adjunct faculty members of the Community College of Beaver County (CCBC) on a project to incorporate East European history and literature into the community college curriculum. Two REES-affiliated scholars organize all aspects of the program: Joel Brady (history and religious studies), whose expertise is in the northern tier of countries including Poland, Slovakia, and Ukraine; and Ljiljana Duraskovic (Slavic languages and literatures), an expert on the Balkans region, including Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, and Herzegovina. These two scholars also team-teach with two CCBC faculty members a new Eastern Europe-focused section of CCBC's existing world literature survey course in Fall 2015, to be taught solely by CCBC instructors the following year. Eight workshops meet January through April in 2015 to explore texts in three areas: 1) general readings such as Tony Judt's The Past Is Another Country: Myth and Memory in Postwar Europe; 2) works that narrate histories of East European immigrant communities in the United States and especially in western Pennsylvania; and 3) country- or region-specific readings (list to be finalized). The latter could include Death in Danzig, a Polish novel by Stefan Chwin about forced population movements at the end of World War II); Burden of Dreams: History and Identity in Post-Soviet Ukraine (Catherine Wanner); and The Krajina Chronicle: A History of Serbs in Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia (Srdja Trifkovic). From September 2015 to April 2016, the project cohort would attend monthly Saturday morning events involving presentations by Pittsburgh-area scholars and discussions with leaders of East European ethnic communities in the region.

<p>This project will advance work toward creation of a world-historical gazetteer that will provide comprehensive databases of places throughout the world since 1500 CE, including attention to the range of attributes known for each place. To satisfy the needs of all the large-scale historical data resources now being created, there is need for such a comprehensive and general gazetteer system. The convening of a two-day workshop, including leading figures who have developed gazetteers and the datasets in which they are incorporated, will bring about a research design for this world-historical gazetteer system, which can then be implemented in subsequent work. Four small research tasks concerning services, standards, and content will bring immediate advance toward implementation. The project is organized by the Collaborative for Historical Information and Analysis (CHIA), which has a record in sustaining collaborations for large-scale humanities work.</p>",

Neoliberalism facilitates the formation of a new ethnolinguistically self-identified Gaelic-speaking middle class, but it impedes the sociolinguistic goal of transmitting Gaelic to future generations. Gaelic has been undergoing language shift in Scotland since 1200 CE: it is gradually being replaced by English in its former locations and contexts of use. This endangered language is now spoken by about 50,000 people. In the 1980s-90s native Gaelic-English bilinguals and supporters with experience in English-speaking industry and business coalesced around the agenda of economically developing Gaelic in Thatcher's Britain. They successfully garnered public funding that created new middle-class jobs requiring Gaelic, but declining numbers of speakers show that labor and commerce alone cannot produce the new speakers and attitudes needed to save Gaelic.</p>",

Experience, I argue, does not yield categorical entitlements to propositions; it yields instead conditional entitlements. My aim in the new book is to offer an account that explains how conscious experience plays this kind of rational role. The central notion in the account is that of presence. I argue that both subjective and objective entities can be present in conscious experience, but the distinction between the two is not given in experience. The entities present fix the subjective character of the experience--and hence its conditional rational role--but they do not determine categorical rational entitlements.</p>",

The book will present a social history of artisans during Early Imperial China (221 BC-Ad 220). As in the Roman world, an artisan in China was defined as anyone or made or decorated things with their hands. In China, this label included painters, sculptors, founders, masons, woodcarvers, and many other occupations. Because artisans toiled with their hands, they were denigrated by Chinese intellectuals and men in power. Thus, few historical texts record their activities or describe their living and working conditions. In fact, no monograph in English has ever attempted to detail the social and economic circumstances of this group. I intend to use a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to reconstruct the lives and careers of men and women in this vital social group in Early China. I will utilize the scattered references to artisans in received texts, and bolster them with analyses of excavated workshop sites, pictorial depictions of artisans at work, recently excavated contemporary texts, and inscriptions carved on objects by the artisans themselves. I will break down this social history contextually, separately addressing ""Artisans in Society,"" ""Artisans in the Workshop,"" ""Artisans in the Marketplace,"" ""The Illustrative Artisan,"" and ""The Un-free Artisan.""

<p>This project will make available on computer, CD, and in printed form, pages of illuminated manuscripts of the immensely popular medieval Arthurian romances from three early fourteenth-century copies of the Lancelot-Graal romance housed in major research libraries, together with description, analysis, and discussion of those pages. An international team of Old French specialists, art historians, and information science specialists will collaborate using a unique adaptation of Geographic Information System software to store, transmit, and link a variety of kinds of information about these images. We expect our pioneering use of this software to be transferrable to a wide range of different intellectual problems which extend far outside the medieval manuscript as well as offering a model for future manuscript studies.</p>",

ABSTRACT: Meeting of Latin teachers and school administrators involved in new Latin programs in inner city schools, grades 6, 7, and 8. Programs have been established in Washington, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Detroit in past 2-3 years. Meetings designed for teachers involved to exchange ideas which have resulted from actual teaching experience. Sponsored by Dept. of Classics, Univ. of Pittsburgh, which wishes to become involved in the teaching of Latin to inner-city school children, particularly in the Pittsburgh Public School System. Meeting also designed as preparation for Teachers' Training Institute for inner-city schools, to be held at Univ. of Illinois at Urbana, summer, 1970. Teachers and administrators from school systems which do not have the program invited to attend as observers in hope that the program might be extended to other big city school systems. Need for classical studies in inner-city is expeically great. Relating Latin to English, exploring Latin roots for English words, increases vocabulary and usage. Inculcates interest in study of humanities, use of past to offer insights into problems of present. Funds for travel, per diem and general costs. </p>",
