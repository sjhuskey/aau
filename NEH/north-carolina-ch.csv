<p><em>Chop Fry Watch Learn</em> is a cultural and social history of postwar Taiwan, told through the life and career of Fu Pei-mei (1931-2004), cookbook author and television personality, often called the “Julia Child of Chinese Cooking.” Fu authored dozens of cookbooks and appeared as an instructor on television for four decades, beginning in 1962. Women in her generation, which included both housewives and career women, turned to Fu because she taught them how to cook an astounding range of unfamiliar Chinese regional dishes on their television sets, in ways their own mothers and grandmothers never could. As her fame grew, Fu and her cookbooks traveled beyond the borders of Taiwan, teaching the rest of the world how to cook Chinese food. Fu’s story offers a way to examine a much more personal and intimate set of concerns about food, family, gender roles, and cultural identity. This is not a story of timeless tradition, but of modern transformation—of self and family, of cuisine and society.</p>",

Sea, and the Jewish mass suicide that took place there two thousand years ago.&nbsp; Combining historical, literary,

<p>Two thousand years ago, 967 Jewish rebels chose to take their own lives rather than suffer enslavement or death at the hands of the Roman army. This event occurred atop Masada, a mountain overlooking the Dead Sea that was fortified by Herod the Great. The story of the mass suicide is related by the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus. Josephus ended his account of The Jewish War &ndash; which describes the First Jewish Revolt against Rome and the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple in 70 C.E. &ndash; with the fall of Masada. Whereas for Jews the revolt was a national disaster, Christians viewed the temple&rsquo;s destruction as a fulfillment of Jesus&rsquo; prophecy.  The Jewish resistance at Masada became a symbol of the modern State of Israel as a result of Yigael Yadin&rsquo;s 1963-1965 excavations. Masada: A New History integrates historical/literary evidence with archaeological findings, yielding a gripping narrative that follows the fate of the Jews under Roman rule through the story of Masada.</p>",

<p>Since the mid-18th century, scholars have been accustomed to thinking of music as embodied in its notation. The restrictions of print culture on the publication of critical editions has entrenched this line of thinking. But with the resources afforded by digital humanities, I am creating a multi-media critical edition of the repertory of Italian songs from the time of Christopher Columbus (known as frottole) that displaces this notion and relocates the object of study in music as a sounding work of art. These songs offer insight into human expression in an era of intense cultural change--a time of war, a time of scientific discovery and the exploration of the New World. Many frottole speak to these cultural anxieties, and the repertory as a whole represents a rejection of French domination over the Italian peninsula in favor of the Italian language, its ancient poetic forms, and traditional practices of singing and reciting to the lyre. These songs give expression to Italian humanism.</p>",

I argue that the precariousness of sound media in East Central Europe has contributed to the assumption of a logocentric--too often, silent--cultural history, obscuring a vibrant network of unofficial sound production and reproduction. In Poland, untrained recordists and engineers took recourse to sound media in order to critique top-down narratives, to disseminate music outside of the commercial market, and to commemorate traumatic historical events. The book is structured around three case studies: (1) reel-to-reel recordings in the 1950s, (2) homemade records in the 1960s and 70s, and (3) cassette tapes in the 1980s. In this first large-scale media history of East Central Europe, I reframe the discourse of Cold War music studies, now focused on ideological control and revolution, to a new historiography of music in everyday life under state socialism.</p>",

Responses to this question have changed radically and more than once since the 18th century, when critics first addressed the relationship between a composer’s personal feelings and the emotions expressed in a work of music. Enlightenment commentators viewed expression as a construct calculated to evoke an emotional response. But through a convergence of philosophical, cultural, technological, and economic changes around 1830, composers and listeners alike became more inclined to consider music as wordless autobiography, a revelation of its creator’s innermost self. The ""New Objectivity"" of the 1920s and the high modernism of mid-century marked a return to the concept of expression as an objective construct. My book-length study reconfigures musical Classicism, Romanticism, and Modernism not in terms of stylistic developments (e.g., form or harmony) but in terms of changing ideas about the source and nature of music’s emotional qualities.</p>",

Not only anthropologists but musicians, dancers, and activists as well insisted that objectively understanding black music's trajectory from its origins in Africa to the New World would help solve the problem of racism and raise support for Africa's decolonization. The book argues that their work marked a significant shift in, but not a complete break from, the legacy of nineteenth-century evolutionism. When black music ""sounded"" its African origins, some perceived those performing it as embodying modern man's primitive and barbaric past, whereas for others it signaled an emergent black cultural nationalism that would anticipate black music's politicization in the 1960s.</p>",

One of them was Venture Smith--an African-born New Englander who published his Narrative of slavery and freedom in 1798. Unlike his contemporary Olaudah Equiano, Smith did not feature prominently in political debates and today he is little remembered. Yet, the very features that made Smith's story seem marginal in 1798 make it resonant today: he emphasized interconnections, not contrasts, between West Africa and North America; he challenged easy distinctions between slavery and freedom; and he portrayed the new American Republic as a site of continuing struggles over citizenship, survival, and equality. Taking Smith's Narrative seriously as a text, and bringing to bear an extraordinary variety of historical documentation, I use his story to rethink the emergence of the modern Atlantic.</p>",

I argue that enchanted islands offered fertile ground for representing, affirming, and subverting ideals of power, gender, race, and national identity, and for displaying the seductive powers of art. The enchanted island, as defined in my larger narrative, possessed the French imagination as an ideal site for exploring tensions inherent within and among those ideals at a crucial moment in their development.

<p>In 1950, members of the Frankfurt School undertook a major research project on residues of Fascism in postwar Germany. Inspired by research methods they had absorbed and practiced during their U.S. exile, yet skeptical of the apparent disappearance of Fascist values indicated by occupation authority opinion polls, the so-called Group Experiment sought to probe opinion statements in focus groups for what the authors called the hidden nonpublic opinion. The Group Experiment formed a crucial link between American survey research and later theories of the public sphere. It also makes a durable contribution to the theory and methodology of public opinion research. We propose a translation and critical edition of the Group Experiment.</p>",

This component of the project relates material patterns of crop processing and animal husbandry to models of land use and power relationships in order to identify corporate groups and to define the structure of the emerging Greek city-state (polis). The plan of work sets out to examine how the civic center was organized, how agricultural and pastoral production was managed on household and public levels, and what archaeological contexts of food storage, processing, and distribution can reveal about the social organization of the early city. The project's main objectives are to examine archaeological correlates for household and civic organization, establishing conceptual links between agricultural and pastoral production and economic structure and group identity. . . .</p>",

<p>The study of French opera is one of the cutting-edge topics in current musicological research. In the international symposium ""The Institutions of Opera in Paris from the July Revolution to the Dreyfus Affair,"" both leading and promising younger scholars in the field of Opera Studies will come together to focus, for the first time, on the vital issue of ""institution"" with respect to French opera in the nineteenth century. The subsequent publication of the reworked papers (planned with Princeton University Press) will constitute a significant contribution to the study not only of opera in the nineteenth century but also French cultural life. The audience for both symposium and book will be graduate students and scholars in musicology, cultural studies, French studies, history and intellectual history. No other genre was more central to cultural life in nineteenth-century Paris than opera, and the opera house served as stage not only for the art works themselves but for France as a nation in all its complexities and contradictions. The intricate interfaces of institution, musical production and reception have been explored in studies of individual opera houses, selected repertoires or limited time periods. What is lacking, however, is any major attempt at creating the bigger picture of the intricacies of Parisian operatic life out of these individual puzzle pieces. The symposium and the subsequent book are the first major engagement with these issues on a larger scale both in North America and in Europe.</p>",
