By documenting these dynamics, my book shifts the way we understand civil rights history and current struggles against food disparities in black communities. It offers a new line of inquiry that uncovers a neglected period of the movement when activists expanded the meaning of civil rights to address food, and control over access to food, as integral to social and economic conditions. This meaning-making process is used as a model by black communities today that mobilize around the food justice movement.

By studying African and Afro-Brazilian religious beliefs and practices, place names, and oral traditions alongside previously overlooked colonial documents, I show how memories of Zumbi and Palmares survived in multiple forms in the aftermath of 1695. And I show that a full reckoning with slavery’s legacies and a truly comprehensive system of reparations are impossible without accounting for lineages and histories that derive from other, less commonly recognized forms of inheritance.

While the errors in digital texts are easily observed, the downstream effects

humanities often spring less from the average level of error in a collection
than from the uneven distribution of noise across different periods, genres,

research and discourages some scholars from using digital libraries at all. To
address these problems, we will 1) Create paired libraries of clean, manually
transcribed volumes and optically-transcribed versions of the same volumes,

Arguing that these attitudes misrepresent the history of Judaism, Rabbinic Inferno: Hell in Classical Judaism produces the first scholarly book on afterlife retribution in the rabbinic era (70-700 CE).

<p>“Tree of Pearls” was a slave of obscure origins who rose to become queen-sultan of Egypt in 1250. For architectural history, her patronage was innovative because of the tombs that she added to her husband’s madrasa (college) and her own, thereby making those institutions into commemorative monuments. Thus, for the first time in Cairo, the architectural ensemble was empowered to stand for the founder himself, visibly and unforgettably manifest in the tomb’s high dome rising above the urban skyline. This dramatic transformation--in which architecture embodied human identity--was made possible by a woman whose path-breaking patronage contradicts the prevailing assumption among historians of Islam that Muslim women have historically lacked power and that there was no distinctive female agency in Islamic art and architecture.

The seemingly abrupt discursive shift from post-Civil Rights to Black Lives Matter, from a focus on privilege and progress to a focus on precarity, suggests a pendulum swing between two positions that remain in tension.

<p>Our synoptic edition and English translation will provide critical knowledge about two influential phases of West African history.

The <em>Tarikh al-fattash </em>bears witness on 19th-century West Africa, with the emergence of Islamic theocracies and the escalation of domestic slavery after the trans-Atlantic slave trade was abolished. The <em>Tarikh Ibn al-Mukhtar </em>and the <em>Tarikh al-fattash </em>are thoroughly entangled, and misinterpreted, in the 1913 edition <em>La chronique du chercheur</em>, one of the most widely referenced sources for the history of West Africa.

military surrender, examining&nbsp;how wars end.</p>
<p>In the grim history of war, some victories have been won by the annihilation of the adversary.  But surrender has always been much more common, and complicated, than unmitigated destruction.  The history of surrender encompasses not only yielding by the vanquished but also the victors’ acceptance of this submission.  It is ultimately a history of restraint in war, and it is inseparable from the question of conflict resolution and the development of our existing humanitarian laws of war.  Speculation on how the current terrorist threat might be contained or ended permeates the popular and scholarly literature.  However, such discussions rarely reference the historical record of surrender or grossly misuse the past when they do. My book describes, compares, and analyzes the experience of surrender in different historical and cultural settings.  It will sharpen our understanding of contemporary issues of war and peace by providing a rich and relevant historical perspective.</p>",

Drawing on text, radio, TV, the Internet, and extensive filmed interviews, Desiring Women offers a rich rendering of a previously undocumented French lesbian past. In so doing, it provides the first postwar history of an understudied French sexual minority, shows how lesbians challenged the republican model of French citizenship, and prefigures the ways in which oppressed groups use social media (e.g., the Arab Spring) to drive political change.</p>",

He recorded his experiences in a vivid manuscript journal, but until now his text was known only through an incomplete and heavily manipulated “edition” published in 1885-86, and from a partial English translation (1985) of the 1885-86 text. In 2010-11 Zaugg and Koslofsky discovered a copy of the original manuscript in a Berlin archive.

<p>My book explores how Spanish and Moroccan writers used the history of al-Andalus (medieval Muslim Iberia) as a framework for understanding Spanish colonialism in Morocco (1859-1956). During the colonial period, Spanish writers revived the historical memory of al-Andalus in order to justify Spain’s colonial projects in Morocco. Moroccan nationalists appropriated the Spanish celebration of al-Andalus and repurposed it as a tool of anti-colonial resistance. Thus, the Spanish insistence on Morocco’s Andalusian legacy, which had served as a justification for Spanish colonialism, sowed the seeds of the Moroccan national culture that would supplant colonial rule. My book illuminates the surprising intersections of Spanish colonial discourse and Moroccan nationalist discourse, and it also highlights how the historical memory of al-Andalus has been used to structure debates about Europe’s evolving relationship with the Muslim world.<br /> &nbsp;</p>",

Cahokia’s dramatic mid-11th century AD construction as a monumental capital, built by a diverse, rapidly urbanizing population of immigrants and locals, is a model for the rise of early civilizations everywhere. By isolating the region’s discrete subpopulations and tracking their activities around AD 1050, this proposal will result, for the first time, in a historically detailed understanding of how new agrarian relationships linked farming and farmers with other forces of the world in ways that underwrote Cahokia’s urbanism.

<p>Large digital collections offer new avenues of exploration for literary scholars. But their potential has not yet been fully realized, because we don’t have the metadata we would need to make literary arguments at scale. Subject classifications don’t reveal, for instance, whether a given volume is poetry, drama, fiction, or criticism. Working with a hand-classified collection of 4,275 English-language works, we have discovered new perspectives on the history of genre. But to flesh out those leads (and permit others to undertake similar projects) we need to move to a scale where manual classification would be impractical. We propose to develop software that can classify volumes by genre while allowing definitions of genre to change over time, and allowing works to belong to multiple genres. We will classify a million-volume collection (1800- 1949), make our data, metadata, and software freely available through HathiTrust Research Center, and publish substantive literary findings.</p>",

Secondly, it explores ethnoracial boundaries amongst Mexican indigenous braceros whose stories and presence complicate pre-existing notions of Mexican worker’s nationalism and cohesiveness. Thirdly, Bracero camp sites are examined as they became increasingly important to gender formation amongst male workers and women that participated in the illicit sexual economies that formed around the camp sites.

A significant portion of the collection has been matted and stored properly in solander boxes. The remaining unmatted works on paper, roughly 500 items, are stored with interleaving sheets or paper folders in solander boxes and the drawers of the oversize flat file. There are not enough containers to optimally house the entire collection. This project will assist to preserve important collections for the future by maintaining the best environment for their safekeeping. It will reduce the risk of physical damage to the collection of works on paper due to crowded storage and lack of mats and appropriate housing.

Rather, Chinese films began to play in cross-over theaters mid-century when producers in Hong Kong and Taiwan strove to gain regular scheduling and mainstream U.S. press coverage for their high-quality dramas and musical films. Due largely to the vision of San-Francisco-born engineer-turned-media entrepreneur Frank Lee (1922-2002), films such as the stunning 1964 Shaw Brothers' version of the legend ""Mulan"" ran outside Chinatowns for weeks on both U.S. coasts.

The book's subject is the political organization of the area's farming population from the precolonial nineteenth century to the years of independence after 1960. It focuses on village life and local transformations, but engages critically with colonial administration, Catholic missions and conversion to Islam, and the way markets and taxation motivated local actors to change and to confrontation. The way changing circumstances fostered conflicts within the local communities and the appropriation of extra-local conceptual elements in the century long development constitute an important legacy for the politics of the period of independence. The study is informed by a theoretical understanding of human agency and of historical process unfolding in an open-ended way in response to contingent situations. Parts of the book have been written and a few articles on various themes that are included in the book have been published. I plan to write the remaining parts and to complete the book for submission in Europe, where I will find support from many experts of the area of investigation, where the colonial archives are located in case I need a further consultation during the writing, and where one can find many other resources for the study of colonial institutions in West Africa.

ABSTRACT: Project to establish a critical method for interpreting the non-material aspects of pre-Spanish Andean culture. PI will study early colonial Spanish chronicles on the Andean culture and early colonial indigenous art as well as making an iconographic analysis of the great styles of Andean art prior to that of the Inca. Study will be an application of sociological and cosmological models to the interpretation of ancient iconography. By studying 1) the Inca social structure at the time of the Spanish conquest, 2) the art of the Incas and their colonial descendents in its cultural context, 3) other Peruvian art, PI hopes to establish their interrelationship indicating the continuity of an Andean theory of structure. Project represents one approach to interpreation of ancient Andean art, the only remaining clue to the thought of a non-literate great and vanished culture. Documentation of project--photographs, slides, drawings--will be deposited at U. of Illinois Dept. of Anthropology. Funds for PI's summer salary, travel to Peru and Europe (to study colelctions there), assistant-draughtsman, photographic and reproduction expenses, indirect costs. </p>",

Until Atlanta establishes its projected PhD program, its MA students will normally enter the new Emory doctoral program after their first year of graduate study. Both programs depend on close inter-institutional cooperation, pooling resources rather than duplicating each other. Three joint faculty appointments (in such areas as history, anthropology, sociology, political science, economics, literature and language). Approximately 1/3 of the time of students in the 3rd year of the new doctoral curriculum will be committed to teaching in the Atlanta area, in either a predominantly Negro college or a predominantly white college in the process of racial integration. Funds for faculty salaries, travel, student stipends.</p>",
