It will be the first monograph on the history of black exercise and seeks to expand conventional frameworks of health and citizenship in the humanities, particularly in the fields of history, Black Studies, Women’s and Gender Studies, and American Studies. The project shows that black women asserted their moral and physical fitness for citizenship through calisthenics, gymnastics, sports, walking, and other forms of cardiovascular exercise. In placing black women squarely within the history of American fitness, the book decenters labor as the primary mode of black mobility and physicality. It prompts humanities scholars to think more literally, and in effect more critically, about how African Americans actually “exercised citizenship.”</p>",

<p>Early Judaism is often described as the religion of the book par excellence—a religious movement built around the study of the Bible and steeped in a culture of bookishness that evolved from that unrelenting focus on a canonical text. The proposed project argues, in contrast, that many early rabbinic authorities did not immediately embrace the biblical text as a source of religious knowledge when the Bible was first canonized but were instead deeply ambivalent about the biblical text and uneasy about its status as a written document. Drawing primarily on less frequently analyzed late antique Palestinian rabbinic texts, this project paints a portrait of early Judaism in which religious leaders seldom opened a Bible and even elite religious thinkers might maintain an indistinct notion of the contents of the biblical text.</p>",

<p>My study is a social history of Brazilian family law over two centuries, largely from the perspective of non-marital children. It examines a range of lived experiences and social expectations regarding fathers’ relationships with their children of varied birth-status, as revealed through struggles of non-marital children and unmarried mothers to gain access to family rights by petitioning for “legitimation,” suing for paternal acknowledgment, requesting state pensions or other family benefits, or joining political movements. Analyzing these individual struggles within the context of public debates over women’s and children’s rights, my book reveals ground-level dynamics of major paradigm shifts in the legal conception of the family as it shifted from what legal scholars identify as “the patriarchal, patrimonial model,” shaped by nineteenth-century liberalism, to the “egalitarian and pluralistic model” that emerged from anti-authoritarian movements of the late twentieth century.</p>",

<p>Color is a fundamental tool of human expression and has been for millennia. Understanding how people used color  in the ancient world can tell us about their beliefs, values, and how they viewed the world around them. Color could be found everywhere: in architectural spaces, on sculpture, and in the clothing people wore. Color choices were made at every level of society, from emperors to individuals in their daily lives. Color was a commodity that traveled across the ancient Mediterranean, from western Spain to the Fayoum region of Egypt. Certain colors were so valued – and so rare – that people devised ways to create them chemically. We know much of this thanks to the scientific study of color that survives on artifacts. Technical color research provides physical evidence of the prevalence and variety of color in antiquity, and is changing the way we think about the ancient world.</p>",

<p>Thought crime is dystopian fiction, not contemporary law. Or so we’re told. Yet our legal system actually punishes thought regularly, while our legal philosophy fails to explain what’s wrong with thought crime or to recognize it for what it is. Anglo-American law quietly embraces a style of criminalization where statutes nominally prohibit acts but actually punish offenders for their underlying thoughts. This practice flouts critical but overlooked principles of political morality, principles concerning freedom of mind and the relationship between punishment and policing. Properly conceived, the controversy over thought crime is in fact just one battle in a larger war, a war fought on terrain common to many disciplines in the humanities. It is a war that pits our professed commitment to freedom of thought against our often legitimate interest in regulating the mind—not just in matters of criminal intent, but also in matters of education, mental health, preventive detention, and beyond.</p>",

<p>University of Michigan Press (UMP) will collaborate with the Asia Library and Centers for Japanese, Chinese, South Asian and Southeast Asian Studies to create freely available ebook versions of significant books about Asia published at U-M over the last 50 years. An advisory group of scholars, librarians, and publishers will select 100 titles from the Centers’ back lists that are out-of-print or hard-to-find and make them available in multiple ebook formats and POD. These free-to-read, high quality works about the history and culture of Asian countries will be actively marketed to promote public understanding of the region at a time when this is especially important. The project will also advance campus collaboration and catalyze a reinvigorated Asian studies front list publishing program. Based on usage tracking and advisory group input select titles will be further enhanced through creation of new editions and multimedia enrichment on the next-gen Fulcrum publishing platform.</p>",

This study argues, moreover, that many early rabbinic authorities found that their central canonical text inspired doubts very similar to those expressed by modern skeptics—a form of intellectual dissonance that was tolerable to these late antique thinkers because many early rabbinic authorities cultivated a form of scriptural religiosity that defused doubts regarding the biblical text by embracing the idea of the Bible while simultaneously neglecting the book itself.</p>",

The answer is that the philosophes' found in Rameau's theory of harmony a succinct illustration of their own scientific epistemology. For this reason, the structure of the <em>Encyclopédie</em>'s exposition of Rameau comes to mirror that of its account of human knowledge as a whole. The initially veiled and the progressively more overt critique of Rameau that Rousseau developed across his articles on music, and which d'Alembert subsequently appropriated, thus redounded on the <em>Encyclopédie</em> itself and in the end threatened its editors' global project.  My book's chief methodological novelty lies in its emphasis on the interpenetration between technical questions of music theory and broader issues of scientific method and philosophical psychology.</p>",

Notion lies in ancient Ionia, 15 km north of Ephesus. We focus on the tumultuous era of the 3rd century BCE to 1st century CE, when many cities were radically transformed through local initiative and external coercion. During this period Notion was relocated to a new site, but then abandoned after only a few centuries. Building on the results of archaeological survey, we will examine the historical and social processes enacted in the ultimately unsuccessful reinvention of the city through investigation of its residential areas.

Seven campaigns of excavation have so far already produced key advances in our knowledge. This complex stratigraphic context is being recorded with innovative 3D digital techniques, directly geared to a new kind of peer-reviewed online publication of the excavation results. Continuing and extending this excavation would allow the discovery of another major Mid-Republican public area of the city and the complete investigation of an Iron Age elite compound, throwing more crucial light on the formation process of Roman cities.</p>",

<p>My proposed book project, 'The Stranger’s Voice,' intervenes in central debates within Comparative Literature on the connectivity of pre-modern literary cultures. In particular, it focuses on the migration of a single concept, the gharib, meaning stranger or foreigner, across Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Armenian literatures in Anatolia during the 13th-15th centuries. I suggest that the ubiquitous gharib, which cuts across Islamic, Christian, and Jewish texts, still has relevance today because it serves as a potent figure for understanding what is fundamentally non-native and even cosmopolitan about literary production itself. &nbsp;Therefore, in telling the story of the ever-wandering stranger, this study seeks to shed light on a much larger question: &nbsp;how and why literary conventions traveled beyond the orbit of any single people or language before our own globally interconnected age.<br /> &nbsp;</p>",

<p>""Music Time in Africa"" is the oldest and longest running English-language radio program broadcast to the African continent by the Voice of America. Ethnomusicologist Leo Sarkisian created the weekly program in the early 1960s at the invitation of famed journalist Edward R. Murrow. Leo recorded hundreds of hours of original field recordings in at least 38 newly decolonized African nations and utilized selections from these and other regional recordings as the raw material for weekly 30-minute broadcasts. He scripted the broadcasts - based on his first-hand knowledge of musical genres and cultures of the African continent - which were then performed by a series of popular announcers. Leo embraced the full spectrum of African musical practices. Included within the corpus of recordings are: the only known recording of Louis Armstrong performing at the 1967 Tunis Festival; the first known recording of famed Nigerian Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, the first known recording of Guinea's popular Bembeya Jazz Band, and so much more. Traditional music, chorale music, big band music, Afro-funk, Latin covers, and Western-style opera and symphonies by African composers are included among Leo's 500 field recordings.</p>",

Opera was among several facets of public life that Carpio sought to reform. He introduced a new system of opera financing, raised the level of artistic quality, and produced a series of operas that were more musically and visually innovative than earlier productions. He transformed Naples from a provincial backwater that hosted mostly revivals by Venetian traveling troupes into an innovative, sophisticated locus of production.

Despite tensions and disagreements, two allies worked collectively to secure cultural power and prestige beyond their national borders even as their enterprise complicated the meanings of bordered ""national"" culture.

The central argument is that in these periods the golem legend became a myth of origins for the nascent mediums of film and comics.

For the industry the issue was: could film promotion become a national phenomenon, producing a more or less homogeneous fan culture?

I ask how these conditions affected knowledge production.

How did it persist, when writers contended not only with U.S. domestic repression, but also the disclosure of crimes in the USSR and allegations (many true) of espionage?

Evidence of reception, in manuscript and in print, sheds light on the changing status of literary autobiography between Cellini's time and 1730 when the text was published. My account of its editing and clandestine printing offers rare documentation of how publishers at the time sought to avoid outright prohibition of potentially offensive books. The embrace of Cellini by Freemasons explains why the text was soon translated into English and French, and why Goethe created a version in German. Its reception as Enlightenment literature suggests that readers envisioned the Renaissance court artist as a craftsman-hero and exemplar of natural merit striving against conventional privilege.</p>",

These processes led to greater activism by all three minority groups in Japan, although the influence varied according to their historical backgrounds. Further, the movements all contribute back to the global political arena and elevated global human rights standards, demonstrating a feedback loop to the global regime.

It has been studied intensively by philosophers, but an understanding of its nature has proven elusive. I attempt to provide a new analysis of the concept. Unlike most others, I begin with the question of why creatures with our concerns have developed the notion of possibility.

<p>The project requests funding for the continuation of a 1997/1999 project to decipher, edit, translate, and explain carbonized papyri assigned by the American Center of Oriental Research to an American team of papyrologists (the other half has been assigned to a Finnish team). The ca. 152 rolls of papyri were found in 1993 during ACOR's excavation of a church in Petra, Jordan. They constitute one or more family archives written in Greek, but toponyms and names of houses and apartments are pre-Islamic Arabic in Greek letters. Some of these Arabic names for places close to Petra are still in use and attest to continuous settlement from before the 6th century to the present. Moreover, the archives, spanning most of the 6th century AD (+-528-582/3, perhaps 592), provide Petra and its hinterland with a history that modern scholarship denied it because, according to this theory, the city was destroyed by an earthquake in 551. The papyri attest a strong agricultural economy controlled by landlords who also held influential posts in city and church, a continued presence of the imperial financial administration and the Byzantine military, and the long process of the Roman colonate within the continuity of the local Semitic culture. The wealth of new and unique socio-economic facts encourages comparative consideration of Egypt and, more broadly, the eastern Byzantine empire before the Persian War and the Islamic Conquest.</p>",

<p>This proposal seeks funds for three years of excavation at the site of Tel Kedesh in northern Israel and for study and publication of the finds. The major interpretive questions that we are addressing in this project concern the assessment of the non-Greek contributions to Hellenistic culture in the Near East. The method we are using is the excavation of a rural site where we have reason to expect to find remains of self-conscious non-Greeks, namely Phoenicians and Possibly Jews. From rigorous analysis of these remains we propose to refine and expand our understanding of what pattern of material remains can be reasonably taken to signify Phoenician or Jewish presence at a site. This, in turn, will help us and other scholars to understand better the nature and limits of the complex process of Hellenization in this part of the world.</p>",

ABSTRACT: Continuation of H69-0-164, computer-aided analysis of relationship of behavior of French army officers before and during French Revolution to their social and geographic origins, ages, career patterns, wealth, military experiences and related shifting mental attitudes. Geneological records at Bibliotheque Nationale, Archive Nationale and military career documentation at Ministry of War archives to provide data for computer analysis. Preliminary research suggest that during this period there were parallel movements in army for liberal institutional reform as well as reactionary moves toward limiting social mobility by forming professional military caste system. Intra-aristocratic conflict over these issues emerged in decades preceding Revolution. Quantitative statistical study of individual in army and variation in performance and behavior according to background and career experience will provide base for analysis of social change within aristocracy and intellectual change associated with Enlightenment. Research planning under H69-0-164 led to decision to examine all officers of whole regiment, rather than random sample. Present project to assemble and consolidate data for computer analysis by 1972. Will develop method for analyzing careers. May also revise traditional views about origins of Revolution. Funds for PI, research assistants' summer salaries. </p>",

Three major schools of Japanese court poetry from the 14th to the mid-19th century were descended from Teika; their claims to poetic authority based on blood relationship and on the possession of his personal papers. Their sometimes sharply conflicting poetic theory and practice were founded on different aspects of Teika's critical theories and different stages of his poetic development. Therefore, to study work of Teika and his literary heirs is to study history of Japanese poetic tastes over a period of some 600 years. Fellow research interest have centered on Japanese poetry and poetic criticsim. In 1961, he and Professor Earl Miner of the University of California at Los Angeles published Japanese Court Poetry, a critical study of the entire range of japanese court poetry from the age of primitive song (ca. AD 500) through the decline of the court tradition in the mid-14th century. since then he had been working on late 12th and early 13th centuries, particularly studies and translations of Teika's works, including Fujiwara Teika's Superior Poems of Our Time (1967, with Professor Miner), a complete translation of Teika's poetic treatise, Kindai Shuka. </p>",
