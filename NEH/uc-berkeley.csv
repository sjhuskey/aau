<p>This project advances the documentation and description of Iquito (ISO 639-3: iqu), a critically endangered Zaparoan language of northern Peruvian Amazonia, with a focus on its complex tonal system. Core activities are transcription, parsing, and analysis of texts from circa 1960; re-parsing of re-analyzed texts from 2002-2018; and comparative analysis of these texts to inform ongoing grammatical description of Iquito. Because Iquito's tonal system includes both boundary Hs and HLL melodies that surface in multiple domains and across word boundaries, text-based analysis of connected speech is an indispensable tool for discovery. Thorough documentation of Iquito's tonal system will inform the typology of tone in Amazonia, and contribute to cross-linguistic typology and theories of grammatical tone. New textual data will also speak to other typologically unusual phenomena found in Iquito, including discontinuous constituency and the expression of reality status through word order.</p>",

<p>Demonology is an integral, though often neglected aspect of the ancient Egyptian religion. Defining “demons” poses issues of ontological classification, especially when dealing with an ancient civilization whose sources of study are not always descriptive neither comprehensive. In the ancient Egyptian magical texts and representations, a variegated series of liminal beings act as agents of punishment but also of protection towards the living and the dead. A contextualized and in-depth study of each of the available sources, which will be carried out in the proposed book-project, is necessary in order to understand the role that those agents played in the ancient Egyptian religious beliefs and how people would communicate with demons through magical practices and the help of professional ritualists. By assessing the existence of an ancient Egyptian demonology, the author will also attempt a comparative study with other discourses on demons in the ancient world.</p>",

The well-studied visual and inscriptional record from the city center provides understanding of palace life and dynastic history. Less is known of city life in general. The proposed collaborative research will advance understanding of Palenque as a city. The project on which this proposal builds used contemporary methods to explore a residential compound of a family belonging to the city's elite, showing the potential to illuminate life in the city as a whole. The proposed project will systematically excavate a sample of residential compounds in neighborhoods defined using spatial analysis, to document the way that repeated everyday practices formed Palenque's way of life.</p>",

Uncertainty about the breadth of TDM rights can impede the scope of DH research questions, or unnecessarily expose scholars to risk. Building Legal Literacies for Text Data Mining (Building LLTDM), hosted by UC Berkeley from June 23-26, 2020, will equip DH TDM researchers, librarians, and professionals with foundational skills to: 1) confidently navigate law, policy, ethics, and risk within DH TDM projects; 2) integrate workflows for DH TDM research and professional support; 3) practice sharing these new tools through authentic consultation exercises; 4) prototype plans for broadly disseminating their knowledge; and 5) develop communities of practice to promote cross-institutional outreach about the DH TDM legal landscape.

I now complement this sociopolitical study with a study that explains the accompanying cultural shift—from an “aristocratic” ethos to a “meritocratic” ethos—which I treat in large measure as a product of the rampant migration of the era. Using new digital tools, I will map out the primary routes of elite migration during the 10th c., and assess how migration correlated with a package of cultural changes (including burial culture, language dialect, as well as articulations in literary texts of new “meritocratic” ideals).

Across the chapters, I examine verbal form in terms of the relationships that give it definition: between parts and wholes, structure and duration, inside and outside, word and image, and prose and poetry. Focusing on Melville, whose work has served an exemplary function in the development of American literary criticism, and revising our understanding of the forms and form of his literary career, I provide an alternative to the persistent, resurgent, and misguided choice between “form” and “history,” “text” and “context.” Rather than an alternative to such relations, literary form is located at their tense, vibrant intersection.</p>",

<p>In a world where religion matters so much, we need better answers to the questions of how and why, across space and time, has religion has driven politics. One especially promising approach to a more historical understanding of the role of religion in politics is to study it through the lens of gender. Women are often absent in political histories. But when religious values and institutions are deemed worthy of either protection or destruction by competing (male) groups, the ladies of the altar guild or the planners of the parish bake sale become important political actors. They preserve and extend religious community at the local level. In Mexico, Catholic women are at the hidden center of conservative politics. Using archival sources I show that Mexican women assumed new roles in parish institutions in the early 19th century. I argue that this change was closely connected to their repeated moves into national politics from 1856 until 1953 when they gained the vote.</p>",

humanities PhDs. The University of California at Berkeley (UC Berkeley) proposes
a planning effort for the study, assessment, and recommendation of structural
changes to the formal and informal elements of doctoral education. Our planning
framework is built upon seven areas of inquiry investigated by a critical
combination of senior campus officials, strategic partners, and current PhD
students. Under the guidance of deans and chairs, the planning work will result
in the substantive change of the humanities PhD from a specific form of
research apprenticeship to a means of developing well-placed leaders able to
meaningfully apply the critical tools of humanistic inquiry to a variety of

From India to Japan, they inspired new approaches to imagination and the body, image worship, sacred landscape, local deities, and more. Until recently, most scholars have looked to the canonical tantras to understand these historic developments, but another genre was far more influential. Ritual manuals provided a literary space for innovation and the countless negotiations between individual subjects and the trans-local technologies of tantric Buddhism; this was the literature of lived Buddhist practice. Yet precisely because of their variable and extra-canonical nature, the vast majority of these evanescent manuals were not preserved and disappeared quickly.

<p>Two one-week Landmarks workshops for eighty school teachers on the social, economic, and cultural impact of World War II in the San Francisco Bay Area. This workshop explores social, economic, and cultural change in California's Bay Area as a case study for understanding how World War II altered American society. Three themes structure the program: 1) the movement of populations to and within California, with changes to the cultural landscape of the state and the nation; 2) mobilization for war, and its effects on social roles, the economy, and industrial work; and 3) the legacy of militarization for technology, industry, and civil rights. Project leaders are civil rights historian Mark Brilliant and Rachel Reinhard, director of the History-Social Science Project (University of California, Berkeley), which works with K-12 teachers. Monday's overview of the World War II home front includes a visit to artillery stations in the Marin Headlands. Participants read sections of Embattled Dreams: California in War and Peace, 1940-1950, and Warfare State: World War II Americans and the Age of Big Government by Kevin Starr and James Sparrow, respectively, in addition to primary sources. On Tuesday, teachers travel to Rosie the Riveter/WWII Home Front National Historic Park in Richmond, meeting with real-life ""Rosies"" and learning from oral historian Heather McCarty (Ohlone College) about the role of female and African-American labor, a subject also explored in their reading of Chester Himes's 1945 novel, If He Hollers, Let Him Go. On board the U.S.S. Red Oak Victory, the last ship completed in Richmond's Kaiser shipyards, they meet with veterans who served on the ship during World War II. Wednesday features a session with Karen Korematsu, whose father led the federal legal challenge against Japanese internment, and visits to the National Japanese American Society and Angel Island Immigration Station. On Thursday, participants take up the ""Double Victory"" campaign against segregation and discuss its civil rights legacy. They discuss readings from Maya Angelou's autobiographical I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings and Ronald Takaki's Double Victory: A Multicultural History of America in World War II. Documentaries on Japanese-American internment, ""Blossoms and Thorns: A Community Uprooted,"" and the San Francisco African-American community, ""Fillmore,"" are shown in the evenings. On Friday, a visit to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is coupled with a lecture by nuclear history expert Cathryn Carson (University of California, Berkeley) and readings on the ""Atomic West."" The week concludes on board the U.S.S. Potomac Presidential Yacht, which served as Roosevelt's ""Floating White House"" and is now a working museum vessel moored in Oakland.</p>",

An NEH grant for the academic year 2008-09 enabled STEDT to develop a Sustainability Plan. This plan, is adopted in the current proposal.</p>",

First, my analysis moves through uncertainty to examine how its effects accrete and change over the course of reading. Second, I apply other models of reading to my examples--rereading, intertextual reading, and metareading--to see how uncertainty is refracted through the different rhythms of these ""layered"" reading practices. Finally, I accord attention both to contemporary novels' belated use of modernist techniques of uncertainty and to current technologies that interrogate the physical form of the book.</p>",

The existing web site was created in 1997 on the basis of an earlier version of the underlying PhiloBiblon dbms. An integral part of the project is the augmentation of the data in PhiloBiblon's component bibliographies by the four bibliographical research terms, who are providing significant in-kind contributions.

Constructed in 1950 as generic library space, the building was never designed to meet the preservation and access needs of special collections. Aside from the Reading Room, Doe Annex has no climate control. Storage capacity is inadequate, so that over half of the Collection's materials have been stored at a remote facility. The Project, which includes renovation activities exclusively, has five elements: 1) an HVAC system devoted to Pictorial Collection; 2) Cold storage and sub-zero storage units; 3) Flat-file equipment for the storage of oversized works on paper; 4) Art rack equipment; and 5) Staffing to rehouse film-based media.</p>",

<p>The University of California, Berkeley, has sponsored language documentation throughout California and the American West since 1901. For the past 55 years this work has largely been undertaken by linguists affiliated with the Survey of California and Other Indian Languages (SCOIL). The products of this research and that of other linguists included field notes, manuscripts, and audio recordings housed in four Berkeley repositories. The Bancroft Library and Hearst Museum of Anthropology hold most of the older records; materials collected since 1952 are housed in SCOIL and the Berkeley Language Center. Together these collections form the largest university archive of Native American language materials and one of the five most important American linguistic archives of any kind. Despite its importance, this material is inconsistently described, making it difficult to locate resources related to a specific interest. With the assistance of a professional archivist--who is also a trained linguist with experience in language documentation--the project's staff would improve the quality and quantity of information in the SCOIL catalog; create metadata records conforming to the Open Language Archiving Community standard to share information across institutions; devise a controlled vocabulary for California languages that relates the designations used by both scholars and Native communities; and develop a Web interface to provide access to full metadata for all SCOIL collections and abbreviated metadata for related resources at other Berkeley repositories, as well as links to digitized SCOIL materials. The project would also support Native American community revitalization and documentation efforts. Access and use policies would be refined, and staff would provide professional and research support to community-based projects.</p>",

We propose a discussion of cultural authority, social agency, and shifting identities during these decades of evolutionary change when the dismantling of the Soviet system began from within. Participants will examine the ways in which new research on the Thaw develops our understanding of the Soviet experience. Our conference seeks to initiate discussion on the Thaw between several generations of scholars, between researchers working in Russia and in the West, and across disciplines. The conference will gather about 50 sociologists, literary and film scholars, art historians, anthropologists, musicologists, and historians from leading academic institutions in North America, Russia, and Europe.</p>",

Will combine statistical analysis and interpretation demonstrating similarities and differences between contemporary and older works with historical perspective of social, psychological and literary factors. Will provide broad, systematic framework and humanistic method for analysis and idea development. Works of fantasy considered similar to Rorschach tests in describing significant relations between ego and inner world. While fantasy reflects social change less than realistic fiction, main archetypal figures (e.g. wizard, magical woman) are response to deficiencies in ego's relation to outer world. Attempt to relate relevance of archetype at given time; and differences in patterning of style and theme to social pressures and cultural conditions of that era may reflect increase in ego vigilance, change in sex roles, increased impersonalization of social life and psychological reactions to massive aggression. Resulting project two papers, one for psychological journal and one for humanists, each development different aspects of study, but both contributing to preparation of book on authors and themes in children's literature. Significant study of social and psychological context of arts and use of literary imagination. May help understand impoverishment of imaginative experience of child in classroom.

Three to six case studies in different geogrphic, cultural and institutional settings to be examined; emphasis in data-gathering will be on structured personal interviews and documentary materials. Attempts to be made to gather data on characteristics and attitudes of campus groups as well. Aim of project to provide information to potential experimenters of the problems and opportunities they face in present social and cultural contexts, enabling them to guide their efforts more intelligently. Study may also suggest promising avenues of future research on ways to preserve human values and stimulate democratic participation in large, formalized and impersonal institutions throughout society. Study will be coordinated with Kerr Carnegie Commission and O.E. to insure minimum of overlap with other studies being done on the same issue.</p>",

Around 2000 BC the coffins of Egyptian nobles began to be inscribed with a collection of text designed to aid them in their goal of attaining a blessed hereafter. The texts are usually magical spells, but they often show the acceptable standards of morality and social responsibility and even the worth of the individual in this ancient society. Fellow hopes to find some logical order in the arrangement of these texts which would give greater meaning to the whole and allow comparison with other coffins. Fellow to study coffins at the British and Cairo Museums and visit some of the sites in Egypt where the coffins were found. </p>",
