Since the mid 1980s, many cultural and political initiatives have engaged with the memory of Jewish Spain and attempted to officially reconnect Spain with the Jewish world. Today, all things Sepharad are widely marketed throughout Spain, from cultural festivals, museums, former synagogues and Jewish quarters, to historical novels, travel guides, music and cookbooks. The 2015 Law granting Spanish nationality to the descendants of Jews expelled in 1492 is the latest example of this phenomenon. The broad public circulation of new narratives that are putting Spanish Jews at their center has the potential to produce profound social transformations.

By innovatively integrating music philology and digital technology, MODE introduces a model for both producing and disseminating editions of musical repertories of the Western tradition. The comparison of the sources through new digital tools allows editors not only to produce an accurate version of a composition and to enormously speed up the editing process, but also to improve scholarly understanding about the world of early modern printing.
