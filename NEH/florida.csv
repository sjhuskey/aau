Translation of both volumes is under contract with Oxford University Press to be delivered on January 1, 2023, with each volume at approximately 544 pages.  The Chronicles of Japan is one of the oldest extant written works from the Japanese archipelago. This text contains the Japanese creation myths, the histories of legendary and historical sovereigns from 660 BCE to 697 CE, and many ancient songs and poems. As such, it is the foundational work in premodern Japanese history, literature, and religion, and also relevant to studies of premodern world literature, world mythology, and the production of local texts within the Chinese cultural sphere.  The only complete translation of this text in English was completed by W.G. Aston in 1896. The stilted language, frequent use of Latin, and unclear formatting of Aston’s translation have created the urgent need for a new one.</p>",

Established by the Spanish Crown in 1565, St. Augustine is widely celebrated as the earliest colonial town in North America that is still an active community today. As the capital of the Spanish colony of Florida, it played a major role in the colonial history of eastern North America, and its later integration into the United States strongly shaped the character of the American South.

<p>“These children will be patriots or traitors,” a poster declared in 1965 Cuba, “you decide. Teach them the work of the Revolution.” Yet citizens rarely responded to this call with unconditional support. For this reason, in the 1970s, the state turned to “rehabilitation” of citizens through labor camps, Soviet pedagogy designed to create a “Communist personality in every child” and finally, Fidel’s launch of the Mariel Boatlift in 1980—a policy to rid Cuba of critics accused of lacking “revolutionary genes”. What was it like to grow up in this Cuba? How did leaders go from “teaching the work of the Revolution” to repression and exclusion?  Through unused archives and oral history, I delve into the mechanisms through which grassroots support was constructed and challenged. Finding that the burdens of revolutionary citizenship often blurred lines, I illuminate an ironically apolitical nation within the binary of patriot vs. traitor: there, a creative, collective individualism thrived.</p>",

<p>A major concern about democratic consolidation is the presence of authoritarian enclaves that continue nondemocratic practices at the subnational level.

This project shows how democratic enclaves can protect pluralism and help re-democratize a nation.  Extensive research finds competitive elections and a subaltern politics of resistance in municipalities.  These local dynamics constrain President Ortega&rsquo;s oppression.  We know that democratization comes gradually, requiring years to seep downward into society.  This book demonstrates that the coming of authoritarianism is also gradual, allowing time for defiance.  A politics of local resistance in Nicaragua is impeding Ortega&rsquo;s authoritarianism and may outlast him entirely.

Against this backdrop, it explores the professional identity of the publishers who liked to call themselves ""bookmen,"" and charts their struggles for cultural authority in an increasingly technocratic world. One way in which they bid for that authority was to cast themselves as stewards of democracy, using books and reading to safeguard the nation against the sinister illiberalisms of the period-- fascism, communism, and ""the mass mind.""

<p>This project examines how land, territory, and law have transformed during aftermaths of war in a coca-growing region of Peru. Focusing on transportation histories and everyday material practices of transportation operators (transportistas), it documents changes in rural routes, spatial prohibitions, and land ownership. Because of transportistas' close relationships with features of terrains presently in flux, their experiences offer an excellent means for grasping how prior times of violence resonate today as new patterns of rural mobility emerge. The Topographies of Law project critically extends post-conflict literatures, contributes to theories of space and place in the humanities, and enriches the historical record of Peru's internal war. With a NEH Summer Stipend I will undertake two months of fieldwork to order to collect local accounts and visual materials for a manuscript and a digital archive documenting social and topographic legacies of the Huallaga Valley's wartime past.</p>",

Although these antiquarian activities were known to French administrators overseeing the conquest of Algeria, study of the ancient Roman past in North Africa remained haphazard. This project thus offers a nuanced view of the role of the Roman past in French narratives of the Algerian occupation and the building of a new settler identity linked to its soil.

It spans the period from the fall of communism through these countries' ""return to Europe"" as member-states of the European Union. Because of the backdrop of deep repression of homosexuality under communism, the meaning of the term ""gay rights"" in the postcommunist context is more basic than we are accustomed to in the United States. At issue are citizenship rights of free speech, organizing collectively, and protection from overt discrimination. Examining the debate over homosexuality provides a new and compelling perspective on the rapidly changing conceptions of democratic practice, national identity, and belonging in postcommunist societies.</p>",

Baga Mandori (also Baga Ma(n)duri), the focus of this project, belongs to the Atlantic (Niger-Congo phylum) group of languages and is part of the Mel cluster. Baga Mandori represents one of the two linguistic communities-the other being Baga Sitemu-that still use a Baga variety in intra-communal communication to some degree. The language is, however, under strong pressure by Soso, a Mande language and the dominant lingua franca of the region, and first signs of failing language transmission between generations have been noted. The project will combine linguistic documentation with visual anthropology and community training and participation. Linguistic documentation will be in the form of a trilingual dictionary (Baga Mandori-English-French), an extensive grammatical outline, an orthography, and annotated and transcribed audiovisual material from a variety of linguistic genres. Furthermore, a set of ethnographic documentary films using Baga Mandori as the main language will be produced together with the community and integrated into the linguistic documentation. Lastly, the project aims to train a team of community members from a remote African language community to produce good quality audio recordings and transcription in order to empower them to provide their own documentary materials and thus contribute their own vision to the project.</p>",

The ten books of Diogenes' Lives (3rd c.

It is thus the major extant example of ancient philosophical historiography. This new translation will be the first English version based on a critical edition of the Greek text. A reliable and modern English version of this seminal work will not only benefit specialists in philosophy, classical studies, and the history of European thought, but it will also be a valuable resource for the curious and intelligent lay reader. An NEH Summer Stipend will enable me to devote my attention full time to this ambitious project at a critical early stage.</p>",

Arguing that women poets are cultural insiders, I move beyond feminist models that separate women's poetry from the mainstream, the marketplace, and the media. At the same time, I draw from feminist criticism to assess gender issues that shape women poets' participation in the public sphere.</p>",

<p>The Florida Museum of Natural History (University of Florida) requests assistance for rehabilitating the artifacts and records associated with the Pineland Site Complex of coastal southwest Florida. Pineland was the second-largest town of the now-extinct Calusa Indians, who achieved social and political complexity, developed elaborate religious beliefs and sophisticated artwork, engaged in long-distance trade, built earthworks and canals, and demanded tribute from dozens of towns, all without having staple-crop agriculture. The collection results from Florida Museum projects from 1988 through 1995. Every aspect of the work involved public participation through volunteerism, high levels of public visitation, and public-school programming. We propose to rehabilitate the collection by logically ordering each component; resolving provenience, cataloging, and locational issues; rehousing each component using archival enclosures and containers; and creating finding aids for each component.</p>",

<p>Ritual Feting is a two-year project that proposes to undertake archaeological excavations on the mountain summit of Cerro Baul in the heart of the Southern Peruvian Andes. Over one thousand years ago, the summit peak was the religious and ceremonial center of the Wari empire's colony on its southern frontier in the heart of Tiwanaku territory. The research program will assess the archaeological and art historical assemblages in the two most elaborate ritual libation halls on the summit of the mountain peak. The goal is to evaluate the nature of the social order and the co-option of religious ideologies by the summit dwelling elite in their quest to place themselves as the intermediaries between humans and their gods. The project will deliver the material manifestations of this quest and the interpretation of their meanings, disseminated to the local, national, and world communities through museum expositions, an extensive web site, and a graphically-intensive book.</p>",
