<p>Blaxploitation: A Narrative History investigates the emergence of a Civil Rights Movement Black cultural discourse that wrestled over cinematic representation throughout the 1970s. Coined in 1972 by activist Junius Griffin, the term highlighted how upon “discovering” Black filmgoing audiences, the (white) film industry exploited Black actors to create and promote cheaply made films for Black people.  Rather than overtax the theme of white exploitation of Black labor, my book argues that the term blaxploitation also identifies lesser known, yet ongoing, intraracial conflicts among Black artists, activists, and intellectuals.</p>",

It places contemporary fictional uses of character networks in conversation with the roles of network metaphors in discussions of media technologies, business networking, and centralized and grassroots political formations since the 1970s. Drawing on and complementing current sociological work in network analysis, I claim that recent fiction uses networks in innovative ways in its representations of precarity, exclusion, and individual and collective action.

Although there are 1,419 enrolled members of the Southern Ute tribe, there are only forty remaining speakers who are all over the age of sixty. The naturally occurring speech and personal narratives will be collected by interviewing several Southern Ute speakers. This will greatly expand the knowledge and understanding of this syntactically and morphologically interesting language. Specifically, the audio and video data collection will be translated, transcribed, annotated, entered into an electronic database, archived and disseminated to the community. (Edited by staff)</p>",

<p>In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in bringing a new set of tools to bear on traditional philosophical concerns. ""Experimental philosophy"" explores philosophical judgments by conducting experiments on people's intuitions about philosophically important concepts. Research in experimental philosophy already spans a wide range of areas of philosophy, including ethics, semantics, metaphysics, the study of consciousness, the philosophy of language and of science, and freedom of the will, and this work has also attracted the attention of a much broader network of philosophers. Experimental philosophy has grown rapidly over the last several years, but evaluating, conducting, and teaching work in experimental philosophy requires skills that are not currently part of normal professional training for philosophers.

It will include English translations of Spanish primary documents about the Hopis of northern Arizona as well as Hopi oral traditions about the Spaniards, some of which are nearly 500 years old. These oral traditions complement, supplement, and challenge the Spanish colonial documentary record. They also give voice to the Hopis themselves. An NEH Collaborative Research Grant would allow the project to conduct ten more interviews with individual Hopi elders. It would also fund a three-day meeting with the Cultural Resources Advisory Task Team (CRATT), a group of Hopi elders representing villages and clans on all three Hopi Mesas.

Current documentation of the Western Beboid languages is limited to word lists and sketches of noun class systems, and the number of speakers is quite small, ranging from, perhaps a high of 1600 for Fang to a low of 600 for Mbu'. Their small speaker populations and the increasing use of Cameroonian Pidgin in the Western Beboid area puts them at risk for extinction within the span of a few generations. These languages offer crucial links between Bantu languages and the rest of the Benue-Congo language group, the sub-branch of Niger-Congo to which the Bantu languages belong. From the perspective of linguistics and prehistory, the languages occupy what is believed to be the Bantu homeland.

<p>This project involves the transcription into written Hopi, the translation into English, and the linguistic and cultural annotation of a large body of publicly performed Hopi songs currently stored on wax cylinders and tape reels in the Library of Congress and the Archives of Traditional Music at Indiana University. In its present state the material is unavailable to anyone not conversant with Hopi language and culture. The goal of the project is to interpret this material so that it is accessible to scholars. The translated texts will be accompanied by 1) extensive linguistic annotations that explain how the lexically unique song word form is derived from combinations of Hopi words and 2) extensive cultural annotations that decode the metaphors that underlie the meaning of the song words and phrases. The stimulus for this project came from an initial research project that deciphered the meaning of 15th century prehistoric kiva murals by demonstrating the similarity of the images to verbal metaphors in 20th century katsina songs. The insights gained from the project revealed the scholarly value of song and prompted the preparation of the present proposal to transcribe a much larger body of song while elderly speakers of Hopi who are knowledgeable about Hopi culture and cosmology are available to collaborate on the project. Importantly, the transcriptions, translations, and annotations wilL be done by Hopi speakers who will work with a linguist and an archaeologist to produce text and annotations that will be from the Hopi perspective. Each song will be re-sung by the transcribers and, with the transcriptions, translations and annotations, will be put on CDs that will be available to scholars at a number of repositories.</p>",

A timely and urgent need exists to capture on film the naturally occurring speech of the few remaining fluent Nez Perce and Sahaptin speakers before their languages “fade away.” This filmic language documentation project addresses this urgent need and proposes to create a comprehensive record of the linguistic practices of fluent Sahaptian speakers using digital video technologies.</p>",

One goal is to show how beach-going in Rio gave rise to new forms of class-based sociability and altered the rules for the acceptable use of public space. Another goal is to analyze the evolving contradictions between the social and racial segregation that characterized beach-going during much of the 20th century and the widely held view of the beach as a ""democratic space."" That view has clear parallels, which the project will explore, with the once widely accepted notion that Brazil is a ""racial democracy."" The project will show the importance of beach-going as a class marker from the 1920s on. It also examines the partial breakdown of social-racial segregation at the beach, which, in turn, reflects the inability, over the long run, of Rio's upper- and upper-middle classes to isolate their daily lives from the extreme inequalities that mark Brazilian society as a whole.</p>",
