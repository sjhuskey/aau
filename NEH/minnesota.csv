<p>My project will provide the first extended explication of Mary Somerville’s (1780–1872) conception of the unity of science. I will contextualize how her ideas may have fit into and influenced 19th-century philosophical debates about this unity, thereby introducing her as a relevant figure in the history of philosophy of science. I aim to answer the following questions: What is the scope of her imperial metaphor for science? How might she be responding to anxieties about the fragmentation of knowledge and society in early Victorian Britain? Does “unity” for Somerville mean, e.g., having common mathematical formulations, shared simple principles, similar subject matter, or a univocal method of investigation or experiment? All these options were considered in contemporaneous and later 19th-century debates about the unity of scientific knowledge and method, e.g., between polymaths William Whewell (1794–1866) and John Herschel (1792–1871) and philosopher John Stuart Mill (1806–1873).</p>",

It asks how, why and to what effect did the United States develop a constitutionalism enthralled and enclosed by its own origin story. Over ten chapters, The Founding Rules charts a transformation in constitutional ideas and practices. It traces how a divided public, a generation after 1789, turned to the constitutional past to govern their unstable present; it illustrates how this realm of ascribed constitutional history became a locus of power; and it explains how that authority faltered and fragmented around the Civil War only to rise again as a force against Reconstruction. Drawing from a rich and diverse array of archival material expressing constitutional culture, the book will tell readers how and why the Founding was invented, inculcated, reshaped and reaffirmed in the nineteenth century.</p>",

And how do we distinguish “religion” from “superstition” or “witchcraft”? Most importantly, who gets to decide what counts as a religion and what is a superstition – or a crime? My research, “Constructing Religion, Defining Crime: Slavery, Power and Belief,” examines how modern ideas about religion and freedom emerged within a colonial slave society. It shows how the institution of slavery made some religious practices criminal, while others were deemed legitimate. African diasporic religions were especially targeted for persecution and defined as rebellious. Examining this complex dynamic between race, belief, and danger shows that we must examine the history of slavery in order to understand the meaning of religion and the concept of religious freedom.</p>",

I show that the rhetoric of exactitude generated by a new breed of Parisian mathematical physicists corresponded to a push for cultural autonomy in scientific production, and ultimately to the emergence of a distinct scientific field. This bent toward specialization fragmented the relatively undifferentiated span of eighteenth-century “letters,” which had sustained the authority of medical and utility-oriented experimentalists, heirs of the Enlightenment tradition, and neo-natural theological philosophers. The book reveals how patronage dynamics helped proponents of exact science sideline these rivals and institute ideas about the value of “values” that remain with us today.</p>",

Many contemporary political challenges are not just thorny problems but transform the very institutions, engagements, and concepts through which we understand what the activity of politics is and might be.  Other societies and thinkers have faced drastically new challenges to their politics.  So, we propose a course that would explore how political actors make and remake community.  Our first unit, Polis and Empire, turns to the ancient world to reexamine the scope of politics, as it experimented with small city-states and large empires.  Second, Colonial Encounters will analyze the movements of ideas, trades, and people back and forth across the Atlantic.  Third, Revolution Reimagined treats incendiary moments of cultural and political contact.  This course speaks to humanist concerns of how humans forge meanings and communities even from conditions of injustice and inequality.  </p>",

And 2) It will ground this argument in a media-rich e-book publication that showcases and animates a trove of relevant primary materials. In the 1950s and 1960s, the musical score emerged as the essential form for new directions in the nascent avant-garde fields of conceptual and performance art. The project argues that these scores are distinguished by the fact that they allow us to question, in ways that are unique and specific to each score, the minimal conditions and rules for an artwork to take place. These works challenge conventions of notation and performance at the same time that they dramatize specific collisions of different sensuous media: word, image, and sound. In advancing its arguments, the e-book adopts a media-rich digital format that will revitalize the presentation of hundreds of ephemeral documents, images, films, and recordings.</p>",

<p>Revealing Maps is a three-year project proposed by the James Ford Bell Library at the University of Minnesota to discover, inventory, digitize and make Web accessible 30,000 maps bound into 11,000 rare books and atlases of the early modern period (ca. 1350 CE-ca. 1800 CE) that are part of the James Ford Bell Library. We are requesting $349,665 in NEH funding to support this project. Revealing Maps focuses on providing access to this significant map collection via 1) a searchable, Web-accessible finding aid in which each map is fully described according to current bibliographic standards for cartographic materials, and 2) an online media repository, which will provide high-quality images in a flexible viewing environment. Links to the finding aid and the images will be embedded in the Bell Library's web site and tagged for easy access through Google and other search engines.</p>",

We love cherished friends, take pride in our accomplishments, feel shame for our petty cruelties and, perhaps, contempt for the petty cruelties of others. These person-focused attitudes are forms of valuing (and disvaluing) ourselves and others that demand a place in a philosophical moral psychology. Addressing this demand, I question the place of such attitudes in the emotional repertoire of the mature moral agent who embodies prominent consequentialist or Kantian commitments in moral theory. The result, Valuing Persons, is a book that uses examples drawn from pubic life and art to conceptualize these attitudes in a compelling way: proposing conditions on their identification, defending standards for their justification, and probing their implications for moral theory. I seek funding to enable me to complete a chapter of the book on love and, hence, to advance our understanding of the forms of valuing and disvaluing rightly central to morality.</p>",

Despite the universal claims of the French Revolution, an individual only has rights as a member of a nation, and nations have so often been defined in exclusive ethnic or racial terms. The question that runs as a red thread through A World Divided is: who constitutes the nation?

Through empirical research on popular leisure and mass culture, The Sobriety Test will demonstrate that temperance melodrama helped to make rational self-control integral to the performance of citizenship.</p>",

A sustained reading of four important texts in the Hebrew Bible that helped generate this binary model allows it to be challenged. Cuneiform literature, on the one hand, and Jewish literature of the Second Temple period (including the Dead Sea Scrolls), on the other, provide a richer range of options for thinking about how authors and redactors created new literary works in antiquity. Consideration of these comparative models allows the creativity and originality of Israelite authors, who often worked as editors, to emerge. Their redactional compositions gave rise to the idea of divine revelation.</p>",
