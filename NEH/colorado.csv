<p>This proposal is for an Arapaho language documentation project that will also involve infrastructure development and development and application of computational methods. The overall goal is to build a lexical database of Arapaho and produce a bilingual dictionary. The project will involve usage-based lexicographical approaches, possible thanks to the existence of a corpus of 55,000+ lines of natural discourse in Arapaho, all transcribed, translated, and annotated, with most of the material already deposited at the Endangered Language Archive Repository, University of London. This natural discourse corpus, along with additional field research, will be the basis of the usage-based lexical database, fully documenting the lexicon. A lexical glossary and an associated text database will be developed which will include both complete part-of-speech labeling and also syntactic parsing information. Lexicographical tools within the program Sketch Engine, plus some additional computational work, will allow for usage-based study of word frequency, various meanings, common collocations, and syntactic relationships. This information will then be used to create full-word definitions and other usage information, and supplemented by field elicitation and manuscript/archive investigation.</p>",

For both Hale and Dunbar, the train of events that culminated in their choice of opposite sides commenced with their ties to social networks that initially had nothing to do with politics or war.

Participant-observation at four coal mines and the larger community suggests that people create kin-ties with their coworkers as well as with their families at home. Framed by the region's unique historical integration of women into the spheres of political economy, the mining families' everyday practices of crafting kinship at both home and work gesture to an emergent, generally gender-neutral conception of personhood that I suggest corresponds with broader shifts in U.S. gender ideologies and practices.</p>",

These narratives reveal how central banishment was to the arguments over the common law and how it was used to answer questions about sovereignty, or legal authority; jurisdiction, or the space over which that authority was exercise and identity, or who the subjects of the government were and how they related to each other and the law.

Early pastoral thus demonstrates a struggle over the significance of labor: should the shepherd invoke ""otium"" [leisure] or the reformist value of rural labor, a value inherited from the medieval tradition?

In particular, I wish to show, in defiance of contemporary literature on the supposed fragility of human goodness, how the Laws views virtue partly as the capacity to deal with luck in an artful way, and can thus be seen as a call for activism rather than passive resignation about the circumstances we encounter.</p>",

<p>Beginning with victory in the Spanish-American war in 1898, the ""New Empire"" of the United States reshaped political, social, and racial relations across a broad region that stretched from the Caribbean to the Philippine Islands. While this moment has received ample attention from diplomatic historians, much work remains to be done on the broader political, social, and cultural aspects of America's ""New Empire"" as well as its legacy more generally for U.S. history. The construction of the Panama Canal from 1904 to 1914 stands out as the most important moment in the expansionism of the early twentieth century. It involved unprecedented challenges for the U.S. government, which had to manage a workforce of as many as 45,000 workers at a single time. To handle that responsibility, the U.S. created an entire state infrastructure in the Canal Zone. The working people in the Zone, who hailed from dozens of different countries, faced incredible difficulties on the job and in their personal lives, and they developed a wide range of strategies for negotiating with the U.S. government and with one another. The construction project also placed the U.S. government and its employees in an international environment where diverse nation-states interacted and contested the boundaries of power. The U.S. engaged in delicate relations with Panama, most importantly, but also with the governments of Britain, Spain and France. This book will examine U.S. government policies in the Canal Zone, working people's experiences, relations with other governments, and the impact of this remarkable adventure on the culture and politics of the United States. Based upon a wide range of primary sources held in the U.S., Panama, Great Britain and Spain, this project will demonstrate both the wide-ranging importance of empire for understanding the history of the U.S., as well as the insights to be gained by employing an international methodology when interrogating that history.</p>",
