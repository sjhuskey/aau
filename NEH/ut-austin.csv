By contrast, my book explores U.S. literary works that grapple with health care as a system: a complex, often fragmented set of public and private institutions, political choices, delivery models, and people who play a wide range of roles both within and outside of clinical spaces. Critically engaging with literary works that approach health care as a system expands our ability to speak to issues of social justice in ways that include but also transcend individual patient or provider experiences.

<p>Good Measure offers a new history of modernity in the Arab world, focusing not on changes in political leadership or economic relations, but rather on poetry and poetics— and specifically, on the surprising durability of classical poetic forms in modern Arabic poetry. To compose metered poetry in Arabic, I argue, was not necessarily to be backward-looking or conservative. Meter and rhyme facilitated the oral transmission of poetry when publishing resources were limited, and the ancient meters were often used as forms of anti-colonial protest. When Arab poets discussed topics like “freedom,” “constraint,” “unity,” and “originality” in poetry, they were talking about much more than meters, strophes, and rhymes. The language of poetic form, I argue, was a metonymic one: poetry and its critical paratexts became the spaces where Arab intellectuals worked through questions of Arab identity, national citizenship, technological modernity, religion, secularism, and interactions with the West.</p>",

Inequalities of power structured these complex societies and allowed them to modify their environments. I also deliberately span the transition from indigenous kingship to colonial empire. I focus on how environmental processes functioned as a consequence of the struggle for control of the land, water, people and animals on which kingdoms and empires depended. The exertion of power is always met by contest and resistance. Resource access was contested with the weapons of the weak and the weapons of the strong. I will show how these contests shaped the agrarian environment over four centuries. I will especially look at the ecological and political role of human domesticates – from the many humble oxen that tilled the fields to few but lordly horses that trampled over them. This will be an ecology of empire.</p>",

Of the Upper Rio Negro set, the collections of Elsa Gomez-Imbert, Stephen Hugh- Jones, and Arthur P.

Yet an outdated vocabulary of cultural interchange hinders the field, which has struggled to attract Native American and African American scholars in significant numbers. This lexicon has also kept its work from being taken up in other fields. In five short chapters drawing on both major texts and archival sources, this book traces where terms like ""reciprocity,"" ""understanding,"" ""piety,"" and others came from and how they have evolved from the ways they were used in early colonial contexts. It also looks forward, showing how re-assessing such terms can help students of early America speak to broader questions and bring more diverse voices into the field.</p>",

<p>Hybrid Traditions analyzes the ideas about race of prominent 19th and 20th century U.S. African-American and Latin American thinkers.

It argues that both philosophical traditions contain more complicated accounts of racial identity, multiracial democracy, and black freedom than previously understood.

<p>Digital facsimile collections of early modern printed books (books printed on hand presses in the 15th-17th century) greatly improve access to these cultural heritage materials for scholars, students, and the general public. The utility and accessibility of these digital collections, however, has been limited by the challenges of transcribing early modern printed books: their linguistic complexity, unstable orthography (spelling and punctuation), and uneven typesetting and inking make these books difficult to read for humans and machines alike. The goal of this project is to develop and implement groundbreaking methods in the automatic transcription of early modern printed books. This will increase access to books that are not just a vital record of historical thought during this exciting period in European, colonial, and indigenous American history, but also reflect the development of a new, transformative technology - the printing press.</p>",

Work from various disciplines shows that a simile draws in readers both emotionally, by challenging them to provide their own interpretations of it and its relation to the context, and cognitively, by making the narrative more memorable. No study exists that focuses on similes in the Aeneid, and that draws on the wide range of interdisciplinary treatments of how they help a narrative connect with its audience.

But they are currently in accessible to non-specialists.

No other European or American archival source provides such a chronological sweep permitting a systematic exploration of gender relations, sexual mores, and illegitimacy from the late Middle Ages through the Enlightenment. The monograph will address three themes linked to established historiographies: 1) it will contextualize long term changes in sexual mores, illegitimacy, and marriage practices before and after the Catholic Council of Trent (1546-63), which established marriage as they solely accepted commitment between sexual partners. 2) It will locate Spanish trends within Mediterranean, European, and American patters during the Eighteenth Century, the ""Century of Illegitimacy."" 3) It will provide a trans-Atlantic perspective, directly contrasting patters of gender relations, sexuality, and illegitimacy between empire and colony, and between the old word and the new.

Through consideration of public health projects, protectionist labor legislation, and state propaganda, the study explores efforts by Brazilian and American state officials to remake the rural poor and to ""modernize"" the Amazon. In a ""top-down"" analysis, the study adopts a transnational approach to reveal competing and overlapping agendas between Brazilian and American officials regarding state intervention in economic planning, and their attitudes--informed by racial, class, gender, ""scientific,"" and populist ideologies towards the rural poor. In a ""bottom-up"" approach, the book analyses the strong historic links tying northeastern Brazil to the Amazon, the socioeconomic and environmental conditions in the sending regions, brutalizing and empowering aspects of wartime rubber tapping, and the postwar struggle for historic recognition and the social rights of citizenship. The book will not only inform American and Brazilian readers of a relatively unknown wartime episode, but document the historic origins of grass roots mobilization in the Amazon in the 1980s under the leadership of Chico Mendes. As such, I offer important revisions to the historiography of the Vargas era, Amazonia, and U.S.-Brazilian relations. In the process we come to reconsider our understanding of ""traditional"" peoples and, by extension, our historic ties to them.</p>",
