<p><em>Data by Design: An Interactive History of Data Visualization, 1786-1900</em>, challenges the common belief that visualization serves as a neutral method for data’s display. In a series of five “data narratives”—chapter-length web-based texts that employ interactive visualizations in order to advance their claims—I trace the rise of modern data visualization techniques. I connect what I term the “visualizing impulse” to Enlightenment ideas about the primacy of visual knowledge, and to the related concepts of subjectivity, agency, and the human. I show how data visualization carries a set of assumptions and arguments about how knowledge is produced, and who is authorized to produce it. Illustrating how these assumptions were both upheld and contested over the course of the nineteenth century, through both specific visual practices and key political events, I reveal how historical epistemologies, as much as visual form, continue to influence the design and reception of visualization today.</p>",

<p>Handmade: The Moving Image Without Photography reveals a new history of the moving image, told through its engagement with other media and art forms. Think of a Jackson Pollock painting that moves, or a hand-drawn score that produces music when read by a film projector, or a hand-crafted machine that fractures light and bends time without a camera. Through a traditional scholarly monograph complemented by a custom-designed digital companion, Handmade provides a historical and theoretical framework for understanding these artisanal moving-image works and the technologies that make them. Handmade moves from film to performance to video, crossing from the Americas to Asia, so as to demonstrate the global, cross-disciplinary impact of this seemingly anomalous subset of experimental films and practices. In doing so, Handmade also illuminates the intersection of global cinema with other arts, and fundamentally reorients our understanding of the moving image’s past, present, and future.   </p>",

Yet we lack deep understanding of the processes through which scientific understandings are generated. Further, what accounts do exist tend to focus exclusively either on ""cognitive"" or ""cultural"" factors, which are seen as separate interpretive categories. Yet the practice of science requires the sophisticated kind of cognition that only rich social, cultural, and material environments can enable. This project seeks to develop an account of the interplay of cognition and culture in perhaps the most ""cognitive"" of human activities: reasoning. It aims at an account in which cognition and culture are mutually implicative in the modeling practices that create novel understandings of nature.</p>",

Working closely with the archives in Padua and Venice, I argue that the shift from temporary to permanent anatomy theaters coincided with the development of theatrical yet philosophical demonstrations of anatomy. These demonstrations combined lectures on anatomy with musical performances; and they began to attract a range of spectators: students and professors as well as fish sellers, tailors, and shoemakers. Exploring this curious relationship between rhetoric, drama and science, my project addresses the academic study of anatomy as well as the literary and aesthetic conventions that shaped its popular reception.</p>",

To date, however, there has been no discussion of the relationship between these political practices and midcentury women’s literary activities. Galactic Suburbia shows how women used one of the period’s most popular literary genres, science fiction, to articulate the radical politics of motherhood. In doing so, they produced a rich, critically-engaged body of fiction, the import of which has gone unnoticed by standard literary and cultural histories.</p>",
