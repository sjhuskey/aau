My objectives are (1) to detail the history of this military network and the private-public partnerships that make it run; (2) to investigate AFN’s role in habituating US and other citizens to an increasingly militarized US foreign policy post-World War II, and (3) to show how AFN functioned, both formally and informally, as a tool of public diplomacy during the Cold War. The study fills a gap in US broadcast history and contributes to debates over the relationship between militarism and empire, hard versus soft power, in the fields of American Studies, critical military studies, public diplomacy, and the history of US foreign relations.</p>",

<p>My book project tracks libels through and around the early modern theater. In the 1590s, a series of crises—simmering xenophobia, years of dearth and hunger, surges of religious persecution—sparked an unprecedented explosion of libeling. The same years also saw the first appearances of libels on the London stage. These defamatory, seditious texts are launched into the sky, cast in a window, affixed to a statue, recited in court, read from a pulpit, and seized by informers. I argue that these overlooked representations of libel have much to tell us about England’s nascent public sphere and the place of drama within it. Libels were marked by mobility: they swirled across the early modern media and across class, confessional, and geographical boundaries. From London to Lincolnshire, amateur and professional playmakers alike staged all sorts of seditious scripts. I study the diverse contact zones between libels and plays, tracing the contours of a viral and virulent media ecosystem.</p>",

Gilpin moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1945, prompted by personal as well as professional considerations, as the city was a center for lesbian as well as Indigenous culture in the Southwest. By the 1940s, Gilpin had established herself in photographic circles as an authority on the prototypically modern southwestern landscape, and on the people and material culture of the Pueblo and Navajo nations that surrounded her. Gilpin had begun working on the Navajo Nation when her partner, Elizabeth Forster, accepted a job there in 1931. She subsequently spent over three decades developing her 1968 book, <em>The Enduring Navaho</em>.</p>",

<p>The Philbrook Museum of Art HVAC system is in great need of a total overhaul. Major concerns include: 1) The two boilers we have are over 25 years old, are inefficient, and have outlived their useful life. 2) The eight air handlers we have are also all over 25 years old and have likewise outlived their useful life. 3) The software related to our control panel is in need of upgrades.  In visiting with Philbrook leadership in both the Curatorial and Facility Departments, they feel that this is the single largest barrier to Philbrook’s ability to ensure the long-term stability of the collection as an organization over the next 20 years.  Furthermore, as environmental standards in the field have changed especially over the past ten years, reexamining the needs of the collection vis-à-vis sustainable approaches to preventative conservation is a top institutional priority.</p>",

In the midst of the Black Freedom Struggle, African American students sought reforms at school-- though at their own peril. Until 1969, the US Supreme Court had not recognized public school students as possessing any constitutional rights, putting students who protested at the risk of suspension or expulsion for their actions. Ultimately, student protest and the litigation initiated on students' behalf pushed the courts to recognize that students did have some rights, including due process. At the same time, the courts mainly protected the rights of students who were not disruptive.</p>",

Rather, Plato depicts in the ""Theaetetus"" a form of dialectic which follows upon this aporia and which he has developed in the ""Meno"", ""Phaedo"", and ""Republic"". The ""Theaetetus"" thus depicts the method by which Plato recommends that we and his interlocutors are to acquire the knowledge we have recognized that we lack. Such a reading enhances our understanding of Plato's method of philosophical inquiry developed in the ""Meno"", ""Phaedo"", and ""Republic"", deepens our understanding of the arguments in the ""Theaetetus"", and looks forward to the method of inquiry displayed in the ""Sophist"", for example, in Aristotle, and beyond.</p>",

Through a cross-generic, interdisciplinary examination of vernacular musical and poetic genres, this book shows how medieval clerics fused scholastic writing methods with contemporary vernacular song traditions, elevating vernacular expression. The book expands our histories of song, languages, literature, and the university, and places the rise of Old French in a trans-historical and global context as one of many cases in which the vernacular has challenged, amalgamated, or even upended languages of cultural dominance and power.</p>",

<p>Plato's dialogues frequently situate historical characters in an imagined past, yet invite readers to interpret their action and argument in the light of actual subsequent events. This ""historical irony,"" I believe, can help unlock the meaning of Plato's masterwork, the Republic--a dialogue saturated in the bloody history of the regime of the Thirty, the Spartan-backed oligarchy that governed Athens in the immediate aftermath of the Peloponnesian War. My book project uses historical and literary evidence to cast fresh light on the Republic's human drama. It is a sustained reflection on the implications of what I argue is the tragic fate of Plato's brother Glaucon, Socrates' main interlocutor in the dialogue. The project highlights the timeless moral relevance of the Republic against the backdrop of its poignant immediacy. It promises to clarify the limits of Socrates' philosophical pedagogy and to enrich our understanding of Plato's complex literary art.</p>",

The museum, located within the Miami, Oklahoma Tribal Headquarters as the designated repository of records and cultural objects, comprises 170 linear feet of books, microfilm, photographs, audiovisual materials, textiles, artwork, wooden objects, and beading. The papers of three chiefs document the Miami Nation's tribal government from the 1970s through 2008. The museum's collections also include handwritten notes by the Secretary of the Tribe from the 1930s, the era of the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act and the creation of the first tribal constitution. Broader genealogical collections allow tracing of tribal ancestry. Manuscript and family papers include the collections of the small number of families removed to Kansas in 1846, and then to Indian Territory in the 1870s, the progenitors of most current tribal members.</p>
<p>The Myaamia Heritage Museum & Archive (MHMA) is a fully functional and integrated department of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma. The MHMA serves as the repository for records and objects that have been identified as having enduring historical and cultural value. Our mission is to collect, preserve, promote, and facilitate access to items chronicling myaamia language, culture, and history for the purpose of advancing knowledge and understanding of these to all tribal members, as well as non-member researches. As a young institution, we feel that a general preservation assessment, in collaboration with a professional museum consultant, will greatly benefit us in striving for these goals. From this assessment, we expect to evaluate our current preservation procedures, identify weaknesses, and create short- and long-term plans for addressing them.</p>",

<p>The course envisioned is a sustained exploration and discussion of two closely related sets of core issues that concern us simply insofar as we are human: (1) Mortality and Meaning. Does death negate the meaning of a human life? Or can death give life meaning, and if so, how? What can confronting death teach us about life? (2) God and Suffering. Why do we suffer? Does the Bible help to make sense of suffering? If not, is faith still possible for a thoughtful human being? On another level, the course is an introduction to humanistic and liberating education as such. The readings tentatively selected aim to promote dialogue by tracing the lines of tension between pre-modern and modern perspectives, and between revelation and unaided reason. The readings often anticipate later issues and revisit earlier ones. They span a range of genres, including philosophical dialogues and treatises, scripture, oratory, poetry, drama, and autobiography.</p>",

The project would result in a database, which would be used to produce a dictionary and a collection of texts.</p>
<p>This project would produce new material on Plains Apache, a scarcely documented Athabaskan language formerly known as Kiowa-Apache. The original homeland of the Athabaskan family most likely lies in northwestern Canada and Alaska (where the bulk of the languages are spoken today), suggesting a one-time southward migration of the ancestors of the present-day speakers of Plains Apache. When working with a group of closely related languages, it is often possible to reconstruct earlier forms of speech by studying minute differences that have arisen in each of the daughter languages, because each language preserves the material in a slightly different way. Since Plains Apache is the most divergent member of the Apachean branch of Athabaskan, new material on this language variety would play a vital role in reconstructing the prehistory of the Athabaskan-speaking peoples. From another perspective, the speakers of Plains Apache have been in close contact with neighboring Kiowa speakers for well over 100 years, and it would be interesting to assess the degree of influence between these languages. Because the vast majority of the speakers are elderly, this work is urgent. First, I plan to elicit new material on the grammar, lexicon, and storytelling traditions of Plains Apache in order to expand and complete its existing documentation. Second, I would combine the new data with existing archival materials in a database, from which a series of publications would be produced, including a practical dictionary for the tribe, an analytical lexicon with extensive grammatical information, and a collection of narrative texts. Graduate students and a community speaker would be trained in both fieldwork and database construction.</p>",

<p>This seminar will explore American Indian Ethnohistory, a study of the relationship between Indians and Europeans, using as a foundation in understanding of the evolving nature of tribalism. Initial discussion will focus on cultural anthropology and its early role in developing the discipline, and then turn quickly to the growing contributions made by historians in the field. Some of the earliest ethnohistory looked broadly at the impact of European invasion on Indian tribes, showing in particular the demographic collapse that came with that invasion. This led to what is often called ""victim"" history. But by the 1980s, many ethnohistorians were probing deeply into the way Indians adapted to the European advance, especially how they changed their political, social, economic, and religious institutions to meet the needs of a changing world. It is this new history, of Indians as actors, which we will explore in the seminar in considerable detail.</p>",

I introduce a theoretical notion, 'aesthetic translation,' the process of writers integrating principles of painting, while I address issues of cultural communication implied in the reading of Eastern arts by representatives of the West. 'Japonisme' is essential in the development of French art, inviting aesthetic experimentation and foreshadowing Modernism.</p>",

These letters have long been neglected and constitute a major untapped historical source, reflecting the manifold interrelationships between individuals, between sections of the country, and between local and national concerns, which in turn determine the shape and course of the French Revolution. Study goes behind legislative facade, committe reports, speeches, to attain better understanding of the sociological functions of a revolutionary situation. Lays foundations for comparative studies of revolution and, eventually, for more comprehensive analysis of the social phenomenon of revolution itself. </p>",
