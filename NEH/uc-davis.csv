This theater also thrived across the Atlantic as these two maritime empires extended their reach.

The work is situated in three locales, joined by the commercial circuits of the textile industry: Ottoman Syria (Homs, Hama, Mount Lebanon); New England (Lowell, Lawrence, Boston); and Brazil (Sao Paulo). The emergence of Syrian communities in these towns was complemented by the liquidity of labor among them, and Syrian workers (men and women) circulated the Americas in pursuit of higher wages. Whether in Brazil or Boston, Syria or Sao Paulo, Arab textile workers communicated across oceans to strike better working conditions for themselves, developing a cosmopolitan outlook that was authentically working-class.</p>",

Analysis of Western and non-Western images demonstrates the differing epistemes undergirding Spanish and Aztec conceptions of nature, thus revealing the underlying objective of drainage: to dehistoricize Mexico City from its pre-Hispanic form, freeing it from the hydro-spatial practices of Aztec Tenochtitlan by eliminating its most iconic feature: water.

The strangeness of its form has been recognized but never really theorized, and theorizing it puts a new range of historical data at our service. While its incoherence departs from common Near Eastern forms of storytelling, its sources do resemble these forms in key ways, and the perplexity of its inheritors suggests that its composition departed from both Israelite and early Jewish literary values.

However, at precisely the same time that Ashmole was pursuing his studies, seventeenth-century intellectuals were increasingly mocked because they pursued ""useless"" knowledge, as opposed to those who sought ""useful"" knowledge, such as how to make strong, long-lasting rope. Ashmole's work placed him on one side of an intellectual chasm that remains with us when the value of liberal arts education is questioned and contrasted with more vocational educational goals.</p>",

Based in Sacramento, the western terminus of the railroad, the project includes visits to the California State Railroad Museum, Old Sacramento State Historic Park, the Sacramento History Museum, the Crocker Art Museum, and the mansion of railroad baron Leland Stanford.

Mine will be the first English-language edition with commentary of Philoctetes in almost 100 years to provide adequate morphological, grammatical, and syntactic help for relatively inexperienced students, as well as the kind o observations on language, meter, rhetoric, style, dramaturgy, and performance that are appropriate for more advanced students and scholars. I will integrate textual and literary commentary and offer a more sophisticated literary and cultural interpretation of the play in its mythological, historical, social, and institutional context than is currently available in any edition or commentary, with particular attention to ethical and political ideas and values, dramatic characterization, relations between divinity and humanity, intertextuality between the play and the Homeric epics, and ways in which the play derives meaning from its late fifth-century Athenian intellectual, cultural, and political contexts. Philoctetes is a relatively, and undeservedly, neglected play; it is not read by either specialists or non specialists as often as other Sophoclean dramas such as Oedipus the King, Antigone, and Electra. Yet poetically and dramatically it is a s engaging and rewarding as these works, and the ethical issues it raises--about, e.g., traditional social and moral values in a changed world, political innocence and experience, the exploitation and subordination of individuals to a community's political needs and desires, and the right of individuals to resist such exploitation--are highly relevant for our times. My edition should make the play better known and more widely studied. In this way, I hope to contribute to increased understanding by scholars, students, and general readers of this moving, thought-provoking and timely work.</p>",

Begins with Nietzsche's thesis that ""will to power"" is mainspring of political and social action, then raises question whether there is ""will to law,"" rooted in basic and constructive traits of human nature, which renders institution of law necessary, beneficial and presumably permanent phenomena of human life in society. Source material drawn from psychology, anthropology, sociology, law and philosophy. Widespread skepticism concerning institution of law seems to pervade younger generation, from which future leaders will be recruited. Law deemed to be tool of repression, destined to ""wither away"" in society on future, rather than antidote to the unrestrained roaming of a Nietzschean ""will to power.""
