# Humanities at AAU Institutions

This repository is for information related to humanities department and programs at public institution in the [Association of American Universities](https://www.aau.edu/). I'm exploring this information in part as a member of the [Arts and Humanities Forum at the University of Oklahoma](https://www.ou.edu/humanitiesforum/)'s Faculty Advisory Committee. I'm also just curious about the humanities at major research universities.
